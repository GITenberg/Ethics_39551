<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The significance of this text in Ethics lies in its effort
to awaken a vital conviction of the genuine reality
of moral problems and the value of reflective thought
in dealing with them. To this purpose are subordinated
the presentation in Part I. of historic material; the discussion
in Part II. of the different types of theoretical
interpretation, and the consideration, in Part III., of some
typical social and economic problems which characterize
the present.</p>

<p>Experience shows that the student of morals has difficulty
in getting the field objectively and definitely before
him so that its problems strike him as real problems. Conduct
is so intimate that it is not easy to analyze. It is so
important that to a large extent the perspective for regarding
it has been unconsciously fixed by early training.
The historical method of approach has proved in the
classroom experience of the authors an effective method
of meeting these difficulties. To follow the moral life
through typical epochs of its development enables students
to realize what is involved in their own habitual standpoints;
it also presents a concrete body of subject-matter
which serves as material of analysis and discussion.</p>

<p>The classic conceptions of moral theory are of remarkable
importance in illuminating the obscure places
of the moral life and in giving the student clues which
will enable him to explore it for himself. But there is
always danger of either dogmatism or a sense of unreality
when students are introduced abruptly to the theoretical
ideas. Instead of serving as tools for understanding the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>moral facts, the ideas are likely to become substitutes for
the facts. When they are proffered ready-made, their
theoretical acuteness and cleverness may be admired, but
their practical soundness and applicability are suspected.
The historical introduction permits the student to be
present, as it were, at the social situations in which the
intellectual instruments were forged. He appreciates their
relevancy to the conditions which provoked them, and he
is encouraged to try them on simple problems before attempting
the complex problems of the present. By assisting
in their gradual development he gains confidence in
the ideas and in his power to use them.</p>

<p>In the second part, devoted more specifically to the
analysis and criticism of the leading conceptions of moral
theory, the aim accordingly has not been to instill the
notions of a school nor to inculcate a ready-made system,
but to show the development of theories out of the problems
and experience of every-day conduct, and to suggest
how these theories may be fruitfully applied in practical
exigencies. Aspects of the moral life have been so thoroughly
examined that it is possible to present certain principles
in the confidence that they will meet general acceptance.
Rationalism and hedonism, for example, have
contributed toward a scientific statement of the elements
of conduct, even though they have failed as self-inclosed
and final systems. After the discussions of Kant and Mill,
Sidgwick and Green, Martineau and Spencer, it is possible
to affirm that there is a place in the moral life for reason
and a place for happiness,&mdash;a place for duty and a place
for valuation. Theories are treated not as incompatible
rival systems which must be accepted or rejected <i>en bloc</i>,
but as more or less adequate methods of surveying the
problems of conduct. This mode of approach facilitates
the scientific estimation and determination of the part
played by various factors in the complexity of moral life.
The student is put in a position to judge the problems of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>conduct for himself. This emancipation and enlightenment
of individual judgment is the chief aim of the
theoretical portion.</p>

<p>In a considerable part of the field, particularly in the
political and economic portions of Part III., no definitive
treatment is as yet possible. Nevertheless, it is highly
desirable to introduce the student to the examination of
these unsettled questions. When the whole civilized world
is giving its energies to the meaning and value of justice
and democracy, it is intolerably academic that those interested
in ethics should have to be content with conceptions
already worked out, which therefore relate to what is
least doubtful in conduct rather than to questions now
urgent. Moreover, the advantages of considering theory
and practice in direct relation to each other are mutual.
On the one hand, as against the <i>a priori</i> claims of both
individualism and socialism, the need of the hour seems
to us to be the application of methods of more deliberate
analysis and experiment. The extreme conservative may
deprecate any scrutiny of the present order; the ardent
radical may be impatient of the critical and seemingly
tardy processes of the investigator; but those who have
considered well the conquest which man is making of the
world of nature cannot forbear the conviction that the
cruder method of trial and error and the time-honored
method of prejudice and partisan controversy need not
longer completely dominate the regulation of the life of
society. They hope for a larger application of the scientific
method to the problems of human welfare and progress.
Conversely, a science which takes part in the actual
work of promoting moral order and moral progress must
receive a valuable reflex influence of stimulus and of test.
To consider morality in the making as well as to dwell
upon values already established should make the science
more vital. And whatever the effect upon the subject-matter,
the student can hardly appreciate the full force
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>of his materials and methods as long as they are kept aloof
from the questions which are occupying the minds of his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>Teachers who are limited in time will doubtless prefer
to make their own selections of material, but the following
suggestions present one possible line of choice. In Part
I., of the three chapters dealing with the Hebrew, Greek,
and modern developments, any one may be taken as furnishing
an illustration of the method; and certain portions
of Chapter IX. may be found more detailed in analysis
than is necessary for the beginner. In Part II., Chapters
XI.-XII. may be omitted without losing the thread of the
argument. In Part III., any one of the specific topics&mdash;viz.,
the political state, the economic order, the family&mdash;may
be considered apart from the others. Some teachers
may prefer to take Parts in their entirety. In this case,
any two may be chosen.</p>

<p>As to the respective shares of the work for which the
authors are severally responsible, while each has contributed
suggestions and criticisms to the work of the
other in sufficient degree to make the book throughout a
joint work, Part I. has been written by Mr. Tufts, Part II.
by Mr. Dewey, and in Part III., Chapters XX. and XXI.
are by Mr. Dewey, Chapters XXII.-XXVI. by Mr. Tufts.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be said that no attempt has been made
in the bibliographies to be exhaustive. When the dates
of publication of the work cited are given, the plan
has been in general to give, in the case of current literature,
the date of the latest edition, and in the case of
some classical treatises the date of original publication.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the authors desire to express their indebtedness
to their colleagues and friends Dr. Wright,
Mr. Talbert, and Mr. Eastman, who have aided in the
reading of the proof and with other suggestions.</p>

INTRODUCTION</h2>


<h4>&sect; 1. DEFINITION AND METHOD</h4>

<p><b>Provisional Definition.</b>&mdash;The place for an accurate
definition of a subject is at the end of an inquiry rather
than at the beginning, but a brief definition will serve to
mark out the field. Ethics is the science that deals with
conduct, in so far as this is considered as right or wrong,
good or bad. A single term for conduct so considered
is "moral conduct," or the "moral life." Another way of
stating the same thing is to say that Ethics aims to give
a systematic account of our judgments about conduct, in
so far as these estimate it from the standpoint of right
or wrong, good or bad.</p>

<p><b>Ethical and Moral.</b>&mdash;The terms "ethics" and "ethical"
are derived from a Greek word <i>ethos</i> which originally meant
customs, usages, especially those belonging to some group
as distinguished from another, and later came to mean
disposition, character. They are thus like the Latin
word "moral," from <i>mores</i>, or the German <i>sittlich</i>, from
<i>Sitten</i>. As we shall see, it was in customs, "ethos,"
"mores," that the moral or ethical began to appear. For
customs were not merely habitual ways of acting; they
were ways approved by the group or society. To act
contrary to the customs of the group brought severe disapproval.
This might not be formulated in precisely our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
terms&mdash;right and wrong, good and bad,&mdash;but the attitude
was the same in essence. The terms ethical and moral
as applied to the conduct of to-day imply of course a
far more complex and advanced type of life than the old
words "ethos" and "mores," just as economics deals with a
more complex problem than "the management of a household,"
but the terms have a distinct value if they suggest
the way in which the moral life had its beginning.</p>

<p><b>Two Aspects of Conduct.</b>&mdash;To give a scientific account
of judgments about conduct, means to find the
principles which are the basis of these judgments. Conduct
or the moral life has two obvious aspects. On the
one hand it is a life of purpose. It implies thought and
feeling, ideals and motives, valuation and choice. These
are processes to be studied by psychological methods. On
the other hand, conduct has its outward side. It has relations
to nature, and especially to human society. Moral
life is called out or stimulated by certain necessities of
individual and social existence. As Protagoras put it,
in mythical form, the gods gave men a sense of justice
and of reverence, in order to enable them to unite for
mutual preservation.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And in turn the moral life aims
to modify or transform both natural and social environments,
to build a "kingdom of man" which shall be also
an ideal social order&mdash;a "kingdom of God." These relations
to nature and society are studied by the biological
and social sciences. Sociology, economics, politics, law,
and jurisprudence deal particularly with this aspect of
conduct. Ethics must employ their methods and results
for this aspect of its problem, as it employs psychology
for the examination of conduct on its inner side.</p>

<p><b>The Specific Problem of Ethics.</b>&mdash;But ethics is not
merely the sum of these various sciences. It has a problem
of its own which is created by just this twofold aspect
of life and conduct. It has to relate these two sides. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
has to study the inner process <i>as determined by the outer
conditions or as changing these outer conditions</i>, and the
outward behavior or institution <i>as determined by the inner
purpose, or as affecting the inner life</i>. To study choice
and purpose is psychology; to study choice as affected
by the rights of others and to judge it as right or wrong
by this standard is ethics. Or again, to study a corporation
may be economics, or sociology, or law; to study its
activities as resulting from the purposes of persons or as
affecting the welfare of persons, and to judge its acts
as good or bad from such a point of view, is ethics.</p>

<p><b>Genetic Study.</b>&mdash;When we deal with any process of life
it is found to be a great aid for understanding the
present conditions if we trace the history of the process
and see how present conditions have come about. And
in the case of morality there are four reasons in particular
for examining earlier stages. The first is that we
may begin our study with a simpler material. Moral life
at present is extremely complex. Professional, civic,
domestic, philanthropic, ecclesiastical, and social obligations
claim adjustment. Interests in wealth, in knowledge,
in power, in friendship, in social welfare, make demand
for recognition in fixing upon what is good. It is
desirable to consider first a simpler problem. In the second
place, this complex moral life is like the human body
in that it contains "rudiments" and "survivals." Some
of our present standards and ideals were formed at one
period in the past, and some at another. Some of these
apply to present conditions and some do not. Some
are at variance with others. Many apparent conflicts
in moral judgments are explained when we discover how
the judgments came to be formed in the first instance.
We cannot easily understand the moral life of to-day
except in the light of earlier morality. The third reason
is that we may get a more objective material for study.
Our moral life is so intimate a part of ourselves that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
it is hard to observe impartially. Its characteristics escape
notice because they are so familiar. When we travel
we find the customs, laws, and moral standards of other
peoples standing out as "peculiar." Until we have been
led by some such means to compare our own conduct with
that of others it probably does not occur to us that our
own standards are also peculiar, and hence in need of explanation.
It is as difficult scientifically as it is personally "to
see ourselves as others see us." It is doubtless true that
to see ourselves merely as others see us would not be
enough. Complete moral analysis requires us to take
into our reckoning motives and purposes which may perhaps
be undiscoverable by the "others." But it is a great
aid to this completer analysis if we can sharpen our vision
and awaken our attention by a comparative study. A
fourth reason for a genetic study is that it emphasizes
the dynamic, progressive character of morality. Merely
to examine the present may easily give the impression that
the moral life is not a life, a moving process, something
still in the making&mdash;but a changeless structure. There is
moral progress as well as a moral order. This may be
discovered by an analysis of the very nature of moral
conduct, but it stands out more clearly and impressively
if we trace the actual development in history. Before
attempting our analysis of the present moral consciousness
and its judgments, we shall therefore give an outline of
the earlier stages and simpler phases.</p>

<p><b>Theory and Practice.</b>&mdash;Finally, if we can discover
ethical principles these ought to give some guidance for
the unsolved problems of life which continually present
themselves for decision. Whatever may be true for other
sciences it would seem that ethics at least ought to have
some practical value. "In this theater of man's life it is
reserved for God and the angels to be lookers on." Man
must act; and he must act well or ill, rightly or wrongly.
If he has reflected, has considered his conduct in the light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of the general principles of human order and progress, he
ought to be able to act more intelligently and freely,
to achieve the satisfaction that always attends on scientific
as compared with uncritical or rule-of-thumb practice.
Socrates gave the classic statement for the study
of conduct when he said, "A life unexamined, uncriticized,
is not worthy of man."</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. CRITERION OF THE MORAL</h4>

<p>It is not proposed to attempt at this point an accurate or
minute statement of what is implied in moral conduct, as
this is the task of Part II. But for the purposes of tracing
in Part I. the beginnings of morality, it is desirable to
have a sort of rough chart to indicate to the student what
to look for in the earlier stages of his exploration, and
to enable him to keep his bearings on the way.</p>

<p>Certain of the characteristics of the moral may be seen
in a cross-section, a statement of the elements in moral
conduct at a given time. Other characteristics come out
more clearly by comparing later with earlier stages. We
give first a cross-section.</p>

<p><b>1. Characteristics of the Moral Life in Cross-section.</b>&mdash;In
this cross-section the first main division is suggested
by the fact that we sometimes give our attention to <i>what</i>
is done or intended, and sometimes to <i>how</i> or <i>why</i> the
act is done. These divisions may turn out to be less absolute
than they seem, but common life uses them and moral
theories have often selected the one or the other as the
important aspect. When we are told to seek peace, tell
the truth, or aim at the greatest happiness of the greatest
number, we are charged to do or intend some definite act.
When we are urged to be conscientious or pure in heart
the emphasis is on a kind of attitude that might go with
a variety of acts. A newspaper advocates a good measure.
So far, so good. But people may ask, what is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
motive in this? and if this is believed to be merely selfish,
they do not credit the newspaper with having genuine interest
in reform. On the other hand, sincerity alone is not
enough. If a man advocates frankly and sincerely a
scheme for enriching himself at the public expense we condemn
him. We say his very frankness shows his utter
disregard for others. One of the great moral philosophers
has indeed said that to act rationally is all that is necessary,
but he at once goes on to claim that this implies
treating every man as an end and not merely a means, and
this calls for a particular kind of action. Hence we may
assume for the present purpose a general agreement that
our moral judgments take into account both what is done
or intended, and how or why the act is done. These two
aspects are sometimes called the "matter" and the "form,"
or the "content" and the attitude. We shall use the
simpler terms, the What and the How.</p>

<p><b>The "What" as a Criterion.</b>&mdash;If we neglect for the
moment the How and think of the What, we find two main
standpoints employed in judging: one is that of "higher"
and "lower" within the man's own self; the other is his
treatment of others.</p>

<p>The distinction between a higher and lower self has many
guises. We speak of a man as "a slave to his appetites,"
of another as possessed by greed for money, of another as
insatiately ambitious. Over against these passions we
hear the praise of scientific pursuits, of culture, of art,
of friendship, of meditation, or of religion. We are bidden
to think of things &#963;&#941;&#956;&#957;&#945;, nobly serious. A life of
the spirit is set off against the life of the flesh, the finer
against the coarser, the nobler against the baser. However
misguided the forms in which this has been interpreted,
there is no doubt as to the reality of the conflicting
impulses which give rise to the dualism. The source is
obvious. Man would not be here if self-preservation and
self-assertion and sex instinct were not strongly rooted in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
his system. These may easily become dominant passions.
But just as certainly, man cannot be all that he may be
unless he controls these impulses and passions by other motives.
He has first to create for himself a new world of
ideal interests before he finds his best life. The appetites
and instincts may be "natural," in the sense that they are
the beginning; the mental and spiritual life is "natural,"
as Aristotle puts it, in the sense that man's full nature
is developed only in such a life.</p>

<p>The other aspect of the What, the treatment of others,
need not detain us. Justice, kindness, the conduct of the
Golden Rule are the right and good. Injustice, cruelty,
selfishness are the wrong and the bad.</p>

<p><b>Analysis of the How: the Right and the Good.</b>&mdash;We
have used right and good as though they might be used
interchangeably in speaking of conduct. Perhaps this
may in the end prove to be true. If an act is right, then
the hero or the saint may believe that it is also good;
if an act is good in the fullest sense, then it will commend
itself as right. But right and good evidently approach
conduct from two different points of view. These might
have been noted when speaking of the content or the What,
but they are more important in considering the How.</p>

<p>It is evident that when we speak of conduct as <i>right</i>
we think of it as before a judge. We bring the act to a
standard, and measure the act. We think too of this
standard as a "moral law" which we "ought" to obey.
We respect its authority and hold ourselves responsible.
The standard is conceived as a control over our impulses and
desires. The man who recognizes such a law and is anxious
to find and to do his duty, we call conscientious; as governing
his impulses, he has self-control; as squaring his
conduct strictly by his standard, he is upright and
reliable.</p>

<p>If I think of "<i>good</i>," I am approaching conduct from
the standpoint of value. I am thinking of what is desira<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>ble.
This too is a standard, but it is a standard regarded
as an end to be sought rather than as a law. I am to
"choose" it and identify myself with it, rather than to control
myself by it. It is an "ideal." The conscientious
man, viewed from this standpoint, would seek to discover
the true good, to value his ends, to form ideals,
instead of following impulse or accepting any seeming
good without careful consideration. In so far as impulses
are directed by ideals the thoroughly good man will be
straightforward, "sincere": that is, he will not be moved
to do the good act by fear of punishment, or by bribery,
just as the upright man will be "governed by a sense of
duty," of "respect for principles."</p>

<p><b>Summary of the Characteristics of the Moral.</b>&mdash;To sum
up the main characteristics of the moral life viewed in
cross-section, or when in full activity, we may state them
as follows:</p>

<p>On the side of the "what," there are two aspects:</p>

<p>(a) The dominance of "higher," ideal interests of
knowledge, art, freedom, rights, and the "life of the
spirit."</p>

<p>(b) Regard for others, under its various aspects of
justice, sympathy, and benevolence.</p>

<p>On the side of the "how" the important aspects
are:</p>

<p>(a) The recognition of some standard, which may arise
either as a control in the guise of "right" and "law," or
as measure of value in the form of an ideal to be followed
or good to be approved.</p>

<p>(b) A sense of duty and respect for the law; sincere
love of the good.</p>

<p>(a) and (b) of this latter division are both included
under the "conscientious" attitude.</p>

<p><b>2. The Moral as a Growth.</b>&mdash;The psychologists distinguish
<i>three stages</i> in conduct: (a) Instinctive activity.
(b) Attention; the stage of conscious direction or control<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of action by imagery; of deliberation, desire, and choice.
(c) Habit; the stage of unconscious activity along lines
set by previous action. Consciousness thus "occupies a
curious middle ground between hereditary reflex and automatic
activities upon the one hand and acquired habitual
activities upon the other." Where the original equipment
of instincts fails to meet some new situation, when
there are stimulations for which the system has no ready-made
response, consciousness appears. It selects from the
various responses those which suit the purpose, and when
these responses have become themselves automatic, habitual,
consciousness "betakes itself elsewhere to points
where habitual accommodatory movements are as yet
wanting and needed."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> To apply this to the moral development
we need only to add that this process repeats itself
over and over. The starting-point for each later repetition
is not the hereditary instinct, but the habits which
have been formed. For the habits formed at one age
of the individual's life, or at one stage of race development,
prove inadequate for more complex situations. The
child leaves home, the savage tribe changes to agricultural
life, and the old habits no longer meet the need.
Attention is again demanded. There is deliberation, struggle,
effort. If the result is successful new habits are
formed, but upon a higher level. For the new habits, the
new character, embody more intelligence. The first stage,
purely instinctive action, we do not call moral conduct. It
is of course not <i>im</i>moral; it is merely <i>un</i>moral. The second
stage shows morality in the making. It includes the
process of transition from impulse, through desire to will.
It involves the stress of conflicting interests, the processes
of deliberation and valuation, and the final act of choice.
It will be illustrated in our treatment of race development
by the change from early group life and customs to the
more conscious moral life of higher civilization. The third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
stage, well-organized character, is the goal of the process.
But it is evidently only a relative point. A good man
has built up a set of habits; a good society has established
certain laws and moral codes. But unless the man or
society is in a changeless world with no new conditions
there will be new problems. And this means that however
good the habit was for its time and purpose there
must be new choices and new valuations. A character that
would run automatically in every case would be pretty
nearly a mechanism. It is therefore the second stage of
this process that is the stage of active moral consciousness.
It is upon this that we focus our attention.</p>

<p>Moral growth from the first on through the second stage
may be described as a process in which man becomes more
<i>rational</i>, more <i>social</i>, and finally more <i>moral</i>. We examine
briefly each of these aspects.</p>

<p><b>The Rationalizing or Idealizing Process.</b>&mdash;The first
need of the organism is to live and grow. The first
instincts and impulses are therefore for food, self-defence,
and other immediate necessities. Primitive men eat,
sleep, fight, build shelters, and give food and protection
to their offspring. The "rationalizing" process will
mean at first greater use of intelligence to satisfy these
same wants. It will show itself in skilled occupations,
in industry and trade, in the utilizing of all resources to
further man's power and happiness. But to rationalize
conduct is also to introduce new ends. It not only enables
man to get what he wants; it changes the kind of objects
that he wants. This shows itself externally in what man
makes and in how he occupies himself. He must of course
have food and shelter. But he makes temples and statues
and poems. He makes myths and theories of the world.
He carries on great enterprises in commerce or government,
not so much to gratify desires for bodily wants
as to experience the growth of power. He creates a family
life which is raised to a higher level by art and reli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>gion.
He does not live by bread only, but builds up
gradually a life of reason. Psychologically this means
that whereas at the beginning we want what our body
calls for, we soon come to want things which the mind
takes an interest in. As we form by memory, imagination,
and reason a more continuous, permanent, highly-organized
self, we require a far more permanent and ideal kind
of good to satisfy us. This gives rise to the contrast
between the material and ideal selves, or in another form,
between "the world" and "the spirit."</p>

<p><b>The Socializing Process.</b>&mdash;The "socializing" side of
the process of development stands for an increased capacity
to enter into relations with other human beings. Like
the growth of reason it is both a means and an end. It
has its roots in certain instincts&mdash;sex, gregariousness,
parental instincts&mdash;and in the necessities of mutual support
and protection. But the associations thus formed
imply a great variety of activities which call out new
powers and set up new ends. Language is one of the first
of these activities and a first step toward more complete
socialization. Co&ouml;peration, in all kinds of enterprises,
interchange of services and goods, participation in social
arts, associations for various purposes, institutions of
blood, family, government, and religion, all add enormously
to the individual's power. On the other hand, as he
enters into these relations and becomes a "member" of all
these bodies he inevitably undergoes a transformation in
his interests. Psychologically the process is one of building
up a "social" self. Imitation and suggestion, sympathy
and affection, common purpose and common interest,
are the aids in building such a self. As the various
instincts, emotions, and purposes are more definitely organized
into such a unit, it becomes possible to set off the
interests of others against those interests that center in
my more individual good. Conscious egoism and altruism
become possible. And in a way that will be explained, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
interests of self and others are raised to the plane of
rights and justice.</p>

<p><b>What is Needed to Make Conduct Moral.</b>&mdash;All this
is not yet moral progress in the fullest sense. The progress
to more rational and more social conduct is the indispensable
condition of the moral, but not the whole story.
What is needed is that the more rational and social conduct
should itself be valued as good, and so be chosen
and sought; or in terms of control, that the law which
society or reason prescribes should be consciously thought
of as right, used as a standard, and respected as binding.
This gives the contrast between the higher and lower, as
a conscious aim, not merely as a matter of taste. It raises
the collision between self and others to the basis of personal
rights and justice, of deliberate selfishness or benevolence.
Finally it gives the basis for such organization of the
social and rational choices that the progress already
gained may be permanently secured, while the attention,
the struggle between duty and inclination, the conscious
choice, move forward to a new issue. Aristotle made these
points clear:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But the virtues are not in this point analogous to the arts.
The products of art have their excellence in themselves, and
so it is enough if when produced they are of a certain quality;
but in the case of the virtues, a man is not said to act justly
or temperately (or like a just or temperate man) if what he
does merely be of a certain sort&mdash;he must also be in a certain
state of mind when he does it: i.e., first of all, he must know
what he is doing; secondly, he must choose it, and choose it
for itself; and, thirdly, his act must be the expression of a
formed and stable character."</p></div>

<p><b>Summary of the Characteristics of the Moral as
Growth.</b>&mdash;The full cycle has three stages:</p>

<p>(a)  Instinctive or habitual action.</p>

<p>(b)  Action under the stress of attention, with conscious
intervention and reconstruction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>(c) Organization of consciously directed conduct into
habits and a self of a higher order: Character.</p>

<p>The advance from (a) to and through (b) has three
aspects.</p>

<p>(a)  It is a rationalizing and idealizing process. Reason
is both a means to secure other ends, and an element
in determining what shall be sought.</p>

<p>(b)  It is a socializing process. Society both strengthens
and transforms the individual.</p>

<p>(c)  It is a process in which finally conduct itself is made
the conscious object of reflection, valuation, and criticism.
In this the definitely moral conceptions of right and duty,
good and virtue appear.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. DIVISIONS OF THE TREATMENT</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Part I.</span>, after a preliminary presentation of certain
important aspects of group life, will first trace the process
of moral development in its general outlines, and then
give specific illustrations of the process taken from the life
of Israel, of Greece, and of modern civilization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Part II.</span> will analyze conduct or the moral life on its
inner, personal side. After distinguishing more carefully
what is meant by moral action, and noting some typical
ways in which the moral life has been viewed by ethical
theory, it will examine the meaning of right and good,
of duty and virtue, and seek to discover the principles
underlying moral judgments and moral conduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Part III.</span> will study conduct as action in society. But
instead of a general survey, attention will be centered
upon three phases of conduct which are of especial interest
and importance. Political rights and duties, the production,
distribution, and ownership of wealth, and finally
the relations of domestic and family life, all present
unsettled problems. These challenge the student to
make a careful examination, for he must take some attitude
as citizen on the issues involved.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3>LITERATURE</h3>

<p>The literature on specific topics will be found at the beginning of
each Part, and at the close of the several chapters. We indicate here
some of the more useful manuals and recent representative works,
and add some specific references on the scope and methods of ethics.
Baldwin's <i>Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology</i> has selected lists

EARLY GROUP LIFE</h2>


<p>To understand the origin and growth of moral life, it is
essential to understand primitive society. And while there
is much that is uncertain, there is one fact of capital importance
which stands out clearly. This is <i>the dominant
influence of group life</i>. It is not asserted that all peoples
have had precisely the same type of groups, or the same
degree of group solidarity. It is beyond question that
the ancestors of modern civilized races lived under the
general types of group life which will be outlined, and
that these types or their survivals are found among the
great mass of peoples to-day.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. TYPICAL FACTS OF GROUP LIFE</h4>

<p>Consider the following incident as related by Dr. Gray:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A Chinese aided by his wife flogged his mother. The imperial
order not only commanded that the criminals should
be put to death; it further directed that the head of the clan
should be put to death; that the immediate neighbors each
receive eighty blows and be sent into exile; that the head or
representatives of the graduates of the first degree (or B.A.)
among whom the male offender ranked should be flogged and
exiled; that the granduncle, the uncle, and two elder brothers
should be put to death; that the prefect and the rulers should
for a time be deprived of their rank; that on the face of the
mother of the female offender four Chinese characters expressive
of neglect of duty towards her daughter should be tattooed,
and that she be exiled to a distant province; that the
father of the female offender, a bachelor of arts, should not
be allowed to take any higher literary degrees, and that he be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
flogged and exiled; that the son of the offenders should receive
another name, and that the lands of the offender for a time
remain fallow." (<span class="smcap">J. H. Gray</span>, <i>China</i>, Vol. I., pp. 237 f.)</p></div>

<p>Put beside this the story of Achan:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Achan had taken for his own possession certain articles from
the spoil of Jericho which had been set apart or "devoted"
to Jehovah. Israel then suffered a defeat in battle. When
Achan's act became known, "Joshua and all Israel with him
took Achan, the son of Zerah, and the mantle, and the wedge
of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen, and his
asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had....
And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned
them with fire and stoned them with stones." (<span class="smcap">Joshua</span>
vii: 24, 25.)</p></div>

<p>The converse of these situations is brought out in the
regulations of the Kumi, a Japanese local institution comprising
five or more households:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As members of a Kumi we will cultivate friendly feelings
even more than with our relatives, and will promote each
other's happiness as well as share each other's grief. If there
is an unprincipled or lawless person in a Kumi, we shall all
share the responsibility for him." (<span class="smcap">Simmons</span> and <span class="smcap">Wigmore</span>,
<i>Transactions, Asiatic Society of Japan</i>, xix., 177 f.)</p></div>

<p>For another aspect of the group take C&aelig;sar's description
of landholding among the Germans:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No one possesses privately a definite extent of land; no
one has limited fields of his own; but every year the magistrates
and chiefs distribute the land to the clans and the
kindred groups (<i>gentibus cognationibusque hominum</i>) and to
those (<i>other</i> groups) who live together." (<i>De Bell. Gall.</i>,
VI., 22.)</p></div>

<p>Of the Greeks, our intellectual ancestors, as well as
fellow Aryans, it is stated that in Attica, even to a late
period, the land remained to a large degree in possession
of ideal persons, gods, phyl&aelig; (tribes) or phratries, kinships,
political communities. Even when the superficies
of the land might be regarded as private, mines were re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>served
as public.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The basis on which these kinship groups
rested is thus stated by Grote:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All these phratric and gentile associations, the larger as
well as the smaller, were founded upon the same principles
and tendencies of the Grecian mind&mdash;a coalescence of the
idea of worship with that of ancestry, or of communion in
certain special religious rites with communion of blood, real
or supposed." "The god or hero, to whom the assembled
members offered their sacrifices, was conceived as the primitive
ancestor to whom they owed their origin."</p></div>

<p>Coulanges gives a similar statement as to the ancient
family group:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The members of the ancient family were united by something
more powerful than birth, affection, or physical strength;
this was the religion of the sacred fire, and of dead ancestors.
This caused the family to form a single body both in this life
and in the next."</p></div>

<p>Finally, the following passage on clanship among the
Kafirs brings out two points: (1) That such a group life
implies feelings and ideas of a distinctive sort; and (2)
that it has a strength rooted in the very necessities of life.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A Kafir feels that the 'frame that binds him in' extends to
the clan. The sense of solidarity of the family in Europe is
thin and feeble compared to the full-blooded sense of corporate
union of the Kafir clan. The claims of the clan
entirely swamp the rights of the individual. The system of
tribal solidarity, which has worked so well in its smoothness
that it might satisfy the utmost dreams of the socialist, is a
standing proof of the sense of corporate union of the clan. In
olden days a man did not have any feeling of personal injury
when a chief made him work for white men and then told him
to give all, or nearly all of his wages to his chief; the money
was kept within the clan, and what was the good of the clan
was the good of the individual and <i>vice versa</i>.  The striking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>thing about this unity of the clan is that it was not a thought-out
plan imposed from without by legislation upon an unwilling
people, but it was a <i>felt-out</i> plan which arose spontaneously
along the line of least resistance. If one member of the
clan suffered, all the members suffered, not in sentimental
phraseology, but in real fact." (<span class="smcap">Dudley Kidd</span>, <i>Savage Childhood</i>,
pp. 74 f.)</p></div>

<p>The above passages refer to Aryan, Semitic, Mongolian,
and Kafir peoples. They could be matched by
similar statements concerning nearly every people. They
suggest a way of living, and a view of life very different
from that of the American or of most Europeans.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
American or European belongs to groups of various kinds,
but he "joins" most of them. He of course is born into
a family, but he does not stay in it all his life unless he
pleases. And he may choose his own occupation, residence,
wife, political party, religion, social club, or even national
allegiance. He may own or sell his own house, give or
bequeath his property, and is responsible generally speaking
for no one's acts but his own. This makes him an
"individual" in a much fuller sense than he would be if
all these relations were settled for him. On the other hand,
the member of such groups as are referred to in our examples
above, has all, or nearly all, his relations fixed when
he is born into a certain clan or family group. This settles
his occupation, dwelling, gods, and politics. If it
doesn't decide upon his wife, it at least usually fixes the
group from which she must be taken. His conditions, in
the words of Maine, are thus of "status," not of "contract."
This makes a vast difference in his whole attitude.
It will help to bring out more clearly by contrast the
character of present morality, as well as to see moral life
in the making, if we examine more carefully this group<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
life. We shall find, as brought out in the passages already
quoted, that the most important type of group is at
once a kindred or family, an economic, a political, a religious,
and a moral unit. First, however, we notice briefly
the most important types of groups.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. KINSHIP AND HOUSEHOLD GROUPS</h4>

<p><b>1. The Kinship Group.</b>&mdash;The kinship group is a body
of persons who conceive of themselves as sprung from one
ancestor, and hence as having in their veins one blood.
It does not matter for our study whether each group
has actually sprung from a single ancestor. It is highly
probable that the contingencies of food-supply or of war
may have been an original cause for the constitution of
the group, wholly or in part. But this is of no consequence
for our purpose. The important point is that
the members of the group regard themselves as of one
stock. In some cases the ancestor is believed to have been
an animal. Then we have the so-called totem group,
which is found among North American Indians, Africans,
and Australians, and was perhaps the early form of
Semitic groups. In other cases, some hero or even some
god is named as the ancestor. In any case the essential
part of the theory remains the same: namely, that one
blood circulates in all the members, and hence that the
life of each is a part of the common life of the group.
There are then no degrees of kindred. This group, it
should be noted, is not the same as the family, for in the
family, as a rule, husband and wife are of different kinship
groups, and continue their several kinship relations.
Among some peoples marriage ceremonies, indeed, symbolize
the admission of the wife into the husband's kinship,
and in this case the family becomes a kinship group, but
this is by no means universally the case.</p>

<p>The feeling that one is first and foremost a member of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
a group, rather than an individual, is furthered among
certain kin groups by a scheme of class relationship.
According to this system, instead of having one definite
person whom I, and I alone, regard and address as father
or mother, grandfather, uncle, brother, sister, I call any
one of a given group or class of persons mother, grandfather,
brother, sister. And any one else who is in the
same class with me calls the same persons, mother, grandfather,
brother, or sister.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The simplest form of such a
class system is that found among the Hawaiians. Here
there are five classes based upon the generations corresponding
to what we call grandparents, parents, brothers
and sisters, children, and grandchildren, but the words
used to designate them do not imply any such specific
parentage as do these words with us. Bearing this in
mind, we may say that every one in the first class is
equally grandparent to every one in the third; every one
in the third is equally brother or sister to every other in
the third, equally father or mother to every one in the
fourth, and so on. In Australia the classes are more
numerous and the relationships far more intricate and
complicated, but this does not, as might be supposed, render
the bond relatively unimportant; on the contrary, his
relationship to every other class is "one of the most
important points with which each individual must be
acquainted"; it determines marital relations, food distribution,
salutations, and general conduct to an extraordinary
degree. A kinship group was known as "tribe"
or "family" (English translation) among the Israelites;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
as genos, phratria, and phyle among the Greeks, gens
and curia among the Romans; clan in Scotland; sept in
Ireland; Sippe in Germany.</p>

<p><b>2. The Family or Household Group.</b>&mdash;Two kinds of
families may be noted as significant for our purpose. In
the <i>maternal family</i> the woman remains among her own
kin, and the children are naturally reckoned as belonging
to the mother's kin. The husband and father is more or
less a guest or outsider. In a blood feud he would have
to side with his own clan and against that of his wife
if his clan quarreled with hers. Clan and family are thus
seen to be distinct. In the <i>paternal</i>, which easily becomes
the <i>patriarchal</i> family the wife leaves her relatives to
live in her husband's house and among his kin. She might
then, as at Rome, abjure her own kindred and be formally
adopted into her husband's gens or clan. The Greek
myth of Orestes is an illustration of the clashing of these
two conceptions of father kin and mother kin, and Hamlet's
sparing of his mother under similar circumstances,
shows a more modern point of view.</p>

<p>It is evident that with the prevalence of the paternal
type of family, clan and household ties will mutually
strengthen each other. This will make an important difference
in the father's relation to the children, and gives
a much firmer basis for ancestral religion. But in many
respects the environing atmosphere, the pressure and support,
the group sympathy and group tradition, are essentially
similar. The important thing is that every person
is a member of a kindred, and likewise, of some family
group, and that he thinks, feels, and acts accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 3. THE KINSHIP AND FAMILY GROUPS ARE ALSO ECONOMIC
AND INDUSTRIAL UNITS</h4>

<p><b>1. The Land and the Group.</b>&mdash;In land, as a rule, no
individual ownership in the modern sense was recognized.
Among hunting and pastoral peoples there was, of course,
no "ownership" by any group in the strict sense of modern
law. But none the less, the group, large or small, had
its fairly well-defined territory within which it hunted
and fished; in the pastoral life it had its pasture range
and its wells of water. With agriculture a more definite
sense of possession arose. But possession was by
the tribe or gens or household, not by the individual:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The land belonged to the clan, and the clan was settled
upon the land. A man was thus not a member of the clan,
because he lived upon, or even owned, the land; but he lived
upon the land, and had interests in it, because he was a member
of the clan."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></div>

<p>Greek and German customs were quoted at the outset.
Among the Celts the laws of ancient Ireland show a transitional
stage. "The land of the tribe consisted of two
distinct allotments, the 'fechfine' or tribeland, and the
'orta' or inheritance land. This latter belonged as individual
property to the men of the chieftain groups."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The
Hindoo joint-family and the house-community of the
Southern Slavonians are present examples of group<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
ownership. They are joint in food, worship, and estate.
They have a common home, a common table. Maxims of
the Slavs express their appreciation of community life:
"The common household waxes rich"; "The more bees in
the hive, the heavier it weighs." One difficulty in the English
administration of Ireland has been this radical difference
between the modern Englishman's individualistic
conception of property and the Irishman's more primitive
conception of group or clan ownership. Whether rightly
or not, the Irish tenant refuses to regard himself as merely
a tenant. He considers himself as a member of a family
or group which formerly owned the land, and he does
not admit the justice, even though he cannot disprove
the legality, of an alienation of the group possession. For
such a clan or household as we have described is not merely
equivalent to the persons who compose it at a given time.
Its property belongs to the ancestors and to the posterity
as well as to the present possessors; and hence in
some groups which admit an individual possession or use
during life, no right of devise or inheritance is permitted.
The property reverts at death to the whole gens or clan.
In other cases a child may inherit, but in default of such
an heir the property passes to the common possession.
The right to bequeath property to the church was long
a point on which civil law and canon law were at variance.
The relations of the primitive clan or household group to
land were therefore decidedly adapted to keep the individual's
good bound up with the good of the group.</p>

<p><b>2. Movable Goods.</b>&mdash;In the case of movable goods, such
as tools, weapons, cattle, the practice is not uniform.
When the goods are the product of the individual's own
skill or prowess they are usually his. Tools, weapons,
slaves or women captured, products of some special craft
or skill, are thus usually private. But when the group
acts as a unit the product is usually shared. The buffalo
and salmon and large game were thus for the whole Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
group which hunted or fished together; and in like manner
the maize which was tended by the women belonged to
the household in common. Slavic and Indian house communities
at the present day have a common interest in
the household property. Even women and children among
some tribes are regarded as the property of the group.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4. THE KINSHIP AND FAMILY GROUPS WERE POLITICAL
BODIES</h4>

<p>In a modern family the parents exercise a certain degree
of control over the children, but this is limited in several
respects. No parent is allowed to put a child to death,
or to permit him to grow up in ignorance. On the other
hand, the parent is not allowed to protect the child from
arrest if a serious injury has been done by him. The
<i>State</i>, through its laws and officers, is regarded by us as
the highest authority in a certain great sphere of action.
It must settle conflicting claims and protect life and property;
in the opinion of many it must organize the life of
its members where the co&ouml;peration of every member is
necessary for some common good. In early group life
there may or may not be some political body over and
above the clan or family, but in any case the <i>kin or family
is itself a sort of political State</i>. Not a State in the
sense that the political powers are deliberately separated
from personal, religious, and family ties; men gained a
new conception of authority and rose to a higher level
of possibilities when they consciously separated and defined
government and laws from the undifferentiated whole
of a religious and kindred group. But yet this primitive
group was after all a State, not a mob, or a voluntary
society, or a mere family; for (1) it was a more or less
permanently organized body; (2) it exercised control over
its members which they regarded as rightful authority, not
as mere force; (3) it was not limited by any higher author<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ity,
and acted more or less effectively for the interest of the
whole. The representatives of this political aspect of the
group may be chiefs or sachems, a council of elders, or, as
in Rome, the House Father, whose <i>patria potestas</i> marks
the extreme development of the patriarchal family.</p>

<p>The control exercised by the group over individual
members assumes various forms among the different peoples.
The more important aspects are a right over
life and bodily freedom, in some cases extending to power
of putting to death, maiming, chastising, deciding whether
newly born children shall be preserved or not; the right
of betrothal, which includes control over the marriage
portion received for its women; and the right to administer
property of the kin in behalf of the kin as a whole.
It is probable that among all these various forms of control,
the control over the marriage relations of women
has been most persistent. One reason for this control
may have been the fact that the group was bound to resent
injuries of a member of the group who had been married
to another. Hence this responsibility seemed naturally
to involve the right of decision as to her marriage.</p>

<p><b>It is Membership in the Group Which Gives the Individual
Whatever Rights He Has.</b>&mdash;According to present
conceptions this is still largely true of legal rights.
A State may allow a citizen of another country to own
land, to sue in its courts, and will usually give him a
certain amount of protection, but the first-named rights
are apt to be limited, and it is only a few years since
Chief Justice Taney's dictum stated the existing legal
theory of the United States to be that the negro "had no
rights which the white man was bound to respect." Even
where legal theory does not recognize race or other distinctions,
it is often hard in practice for an alien to get
justice. In primitive clan or family groups this principle
is in full force. Justice is a privilege which falls to a
man as belonging to some group&mdash;not otherwise.  The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
member of the clan or the household or the village community
has a claim, but the stranger has no standing.
He may be treated kindly, as a guest, but he cannot demand
"justice" at the hands of any group but his own.
In this conception of rights within the group we have the
prototype of modern civil law. The dealing of clan
with clan is a matter of war or negotiation, not of law;
and the clanless man is an "outlaw" in fact as well as in
name.</p>

<p><b>Joint Responsibility</b> and mutual support, as shown in
the blood feud, was a natural consequence of this fusion of
political and kindred relations. In modern life States
treat each other as wholes in certain respects. If some
member of a savage tribe assaults a citizen of one of the
civilized nations, the injured party invokes the help of
his government. A demand is usually made that the guilty
party be delivered up for trial and punishment. If he is
not forthcoming a "punitive expedition" is organized
against the whole tribe; guilty and innocent suffer alike.
Or in lieu of exterminating the offending tribe, in part or
completely, the nation of the injured man may accept
an indemnity in money or land from the offender's tribe.
Recent dealings between British and Africans, Germans
and Africans, France and Morocco, the United States
and the Filipinos, the Powers and China, illustrate this.
The State protects its own members against other States,
and avenges them upon other States. Each opposes a
united body to the other. The same principle carried out
through private citizens as public agents, and applied to
towns, is seen in the practice which prevailed in the Middle
Ages. "When merchants of one country had been defrauded
by those of another, or found it impossible to collect
a debt from them, the former country issued letters
of marque and reprisal, authorizing the plunder of any
citizens of the offending town until satisfaction should
be obtained." Transfer the situation to the early clan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
or tribe, and this solidarity is increased because each member
is related to the rest by blood, as well as by national
unity. The Arabs do not say "The blood of M. or N. has
been spilt," naming the man; they say, "Our blood has
been spilt."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The whole group, therefore, feels injured
and regards every man in the offender's kin as more or
less responsible. The next of kin, the "avenger of blood,"
stands first in duty and privilege, but the rest are all
involved in greater or less degree.</p>

<p><b>Within the Group</b> each member will be treated more
or less fully as an individual. If he takes his kinsman's
wife or his kinsman's game he will be dealt with by the
authorities or by the public opinion of his group. He
will not indeed be put to death if he kills his kinsman,
but he will be hated, and may be driven out. "Since the
living kin is not killed for the sake of the dead kin, everybody
will hate to see him."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>When now a smaller group, like a family, is at the
same time a part of a larger group like a phratry or a
tribe, we have the phase of solidarity which is so puzzling
to the modern. We hold to solidarity in war or between
nations; but with a few exceptions<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> we have replaced it
by individual responsibility of adults for debts and crimes
so far as the civil law has jurisdiction. In earlier times
the higher group or authority treated the smaller as a
unit. Achan's family all perished with him. The Chinese
sense of justice recognized a series of degrees in responsibility
dependent on nearness of kin or of residence, or of
occupation. The Welsh system held kinsmen as far as
second cousins responsible for insult or injury short of
homicide, and as far as fifth cousins (seventh degree of
descent) for the payment in case of homicide. "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
mutual responsibility of kinsmen for <i>saraal</i> and <i>galanas</i>
(the Wergild of the Germans), graduated according to
nearness of kin to the murdered man and to the criminal,
reveals more clearly than anything else the extent to
which the individual was bound by innumerable meshes to
his fixed place in the tribal community."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 5. THE KINSHIP OR HOUSEHOLD GROUP WAS A RELIGIOUS
UNIT</h4>

<p>The kinship or household group determined largely
both the ideas and the cultus of primitive religion;
conversely religion gave completeness, value, and sacredness
to the group life. Kinship with unseen powers or
persons was the fundamental religious idea. The kinship
group as a religious body <i>simply extended the kin to
include invisible as well as visible members</i>. The essential
feature of religion is not unseen beings who are feared,
or cajoled, or controlled by magic. It is rather <i>kindred</i>
unseen beings, who may be feared, but who are also reverenced
and loved. The kinship may be physical or spiritual,
but however conceived it makes gods and worshippers
members of one group.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><b>1. Totem Groups.</b>&mdash;In totem groups, the prevailing
conception is that one blood circulates in all the members
of the group and that the ancestor of the whole group
is some object of nature, such as sun or moon, plant or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
animal. Perhaps the most interesting and intelligible account
of the relation between the animal ancestor and the
members of the group is that which has recently been
discovered in certain Australian tribes who believe that
every child, at its birth, is the reincarnation of some previous
member of the group, and that these ancestors were
an actual transformation of animals and plants, or of
water, fire, wind, sun, moon, or stars. Such totem groups
cherish that animal which they believe to be their ancestor
and ordinarily will not kill it or use it for food. The
various ceremonies of religious initiation are intended to
impress upon the younger members of the group the
sacredness of this kindred bond which units them to each
other and to their totem. The beginnings of decorative art
frequently express the importance of the symbol, and the
totem is felt to be as distinctly a member of the group as
is any of the human members.</p>

<p><b>2. Ancestral Religion.</b>&mdash;At a somewhat higher stage
of civilization, and usually in connection with the patriarchal
households or groups in which kinship is reckoned
through the male line, the invisible members of the group
are the <i>departed ancestors</i>. This ancestor worship is a
power to-day in China and Japan, and in the tribes of
the Caucasus. The ancient Semites, Romans, Teutons,
Celts, Hindoos, all had their kindred gods of the household.
The Roman genius, lares, penates, and manes, perhaps the
Hebrew teraphim,&mdash;prized by Laban and Rachel, kept
by David, valued in the time of Hosea,&mdash;were loved and
honored side by side with other deities. Sometimes the
nature deities, such as Zeus or Jupiter, were incorporated
with the kinship or family gods. The Greek Hestia and
Roman Vesta symbolized the sacredness of the hearth. The
kinship tie thus determined for every member of the group
his religion.</p>

<p><b>Religion Completes the Group.</b>&mdash;Conversely, this bond
of union with unseen, yet ever present and powerful kin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>dred
spirits completed the group and gave to it its highest
authority, its fullest value, its deepest sacredness. If the
unseen kin are nature beings, they symbolize for man his
dependence upon nature and his kinship in some vague
fashion with the cosmic forces. If the gods are the
departed ancestors, they are then conceived as still potent,
like Father Anchises, to protect and guide the fortunes
of their offspring. The wisdom, courage, and affection,
as well as the power of the great heroes of the group,
live on. The fact that the gods are unseen enhances tremendously
their supposed power. The visible members of
the group may be strong, but their strength can be measured.
The living elders may be wise, yet they are not
far beyond the rest of the group. But the invisible beings
cannot be measured. The long-departed ancestor may
have inconceivable age and wisdom. The imagination has
free scope to magnify his power and invest him with all
the ideal values it can conceive. The religious bond is,
therefore, fitted to be the bearer, as the religious object
is the embodiment in concrete form, of the higher standards
of the group, and to furnish the sanction for their
enforcement or adoption.</p>


<h4>&sect; 6. GROUPS OR CLASSES ON THE BASIS OF AGE AND SEX</h4>

<p>While the kindred and family groups are by far the
most important for early morality, other groupings are
significant. The division by ages is widespread. The
simplest scheme gives three classes: (1) children, (2)
young men and maidens, (3) married persons. Puberty
forms the bound between the first and second; marriage
that between the second and third. Distinct modes of
dress and ornament, frequently also different residences
and standards of conduct, belong to these several classes.
Of groups on the basis of sex, the <i>men's clubs</i> are espe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>cially
worthy of note. They flourish now chiefly in the
islands of the Pacific, but there are indications, such as
the common meals of the Spartans, of a wide spread among
European peoples in early times. The fundamental idea<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
seems to be that of a common house for the unmarried
young men, where they eat, sleep, and pass their time,
whereas the women, children, and married men sleep and
eat in the family dwelling. But in most cases all the men
resort to the clubhouse by day. Strangers may be entertained
there. It thus forms a sort of general center for
the men's activities, and for the men's conversation. As
such, it is an important agency for forming and expressing
public opinion, and for impressing upon the young
men just entering the house the standards of the older
members. Further, in some cases these houses become the
center of rites to the dead, and thus add the impressiveness
of religious significance to their other activities.</p>

<p>Finally, <i>secret societies</i> may be mentioned as a subdivision
of sex groups, for among primitive peoples such
societies are confined in almost all cases to the men. They
seem in many cases to have grown out of the age classes
already described. The transition from childhood to manhood,
mysterious in itself, was invested with further mysteries
by the old men who conducted the ceremonies of
initiation. Masks were worn, or the skulls of deceased
ancestors were employed, to give additional mystery and
sanctity. The increased power gained by secrecy would
often be itself sufficient to form a motive for such organization,
especially where they had some end in view not
approved by the dominant authorities. Sometimes they
exercise strict authority over their members, and assume
judicial and punitive functions, as in the Vehm of the
Middle Ages. Sometimes they become merely leagues of
enemies to society.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 7. MORAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE KINDRED AND OTHER
GROUPS</h4>

<p>The moral in this early stage is not to be looked for
as something distinct from the political, religious, kindred,
and sympathetic aspects of the clan, family, and other
groups. The question rather is, <i>How far are these very
political, religious, and other aspects implicitly moral</i>?
If by moral we mean a conscious testing of conduct by
an inner and self-imposed standard, if we mean a freely
chosen as contrasted with a habitual or customary standard,
then evidently we have the moral only in germ. For the
standards are group standards, rather than those of individual
conscience; they operate largely through habit
rather than through choice. Nevertheless they are not set
for the individual by outsiders. They are set by a group
of which he is a member. They are enforced by a group
<i>of which he is a member</i>. Conduct is praised or blamed,
punished or rewarded by the group of which he is a
member. Property is administered, industry is carried on,
wars and feuds prosecuted for the common good. What
the group does, each member joins in doing. It is a reciprocal
matter: A helps enforce a rule or impose a service
on B; he cannot help feeling it fair when the same rule
is applied to himself. He has to "play the game," and
usually he expects to play it as a matter of course. Each
member, therefore, is practicing certain acts, standing in
certain relations, maintaining certain attitudes, just because
he is one of the group which does these things and
maintains these standards. And he does not act in common
with the group without sharing in the group emotions.
It is a grotesque perversion to conceive the restraints of
gods and chiefs as purely external terrors. The primitive
group could enter into the spirit implied in the words
of the Athenian chorus, which required of an alien upon
adoption<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
"To loathe whate'er our state does hateful hold,<br />
To reverence what it loves."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a><br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">The gregarious instinct may be the most elemental of
the impulses which bind the group together, but it is
reinforced by sympathies and sentiments growing out
of common life, common work, common danger, common
religion. The morality is already implicit, it needs only to
become conscious. The standards are embodied in the
old men or the gods; the rational good is in the inherited
wisdom; the respect for sex, for property rights, and for
the common good, is embodied in the system&mdash;but it is
there. Nor are the union and control a wholly objective
affair. "The corporate union was not a pretty religious
fancy with which to please the mind, but was so truly felt
that it formed an excellent basis from which the altruistic
sentiment might start. Gross selfishness was curbed, and
the turbulent passions were restrained by an impulse which
the man felt welling up within him, instinctive and unbidden.
Clannish camaraderie was thus of immense value
to the native races."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

of a group&mdash;that he has as it were two personalities or selves,
an individual self and a clan-self, or "tribal-self," as Clifford called
it,&mdash;is not merely a psychologist's way of stating things. The Kafir
people, according to their most recent student, Mr. Dudley Kidd,
have two distinct words to express these two selves. They call one
the <i>idhlozi</i> and other the <i>itongo</i>. "The <i>idhlozi</i> is the individual and
personal spirit born with each child&mdash;something fresh and unique
which is never shared with any one else&mdash;while the <i>itongo</i> is the ancestral
and corporate spirit which is not personal but tribal, or a thing
of the clan, the possession of which is obtained not by birth but by
certain initiatory rites. The <i>idhlozi</i> is personal and inalienable,
for it is wrapped up with the man's personality, and at death it
lives near the grave, or goes into the snake or totem of the clan;
but the <i>itongo</i> is of the clan, and haunts the living-hut; at death it
returns to the tribal <i>amatongo</i> (ancestral spirits). A man's share
in this clan-spirit (<i>itongo</i>) is lost when he becomes a Christian, or
when he is in any way unfaithful to the interests of the clan, but
a man never loses his <i>idhlozi</i> any more than he ever loses his
individuality."&mdash;<i>Savage Childhood</i>, pp. 14 f.</p></div>

<h2><small>CHAPTER III</small>

<br /><br />

THE RATIONALIZING AND SOCIALIZING AGENCIES
IN EARLY SOCIETY</h2>


<h4>&sect; 1. THREE LEVELS OF CONDUCT</h4>

<p>A young man may enter a profession thinking of it
only as a means of support. But the work requires foresight
and persistence; it broadens his interests; it develops
his character. Like Saul, he has gone to search for
asses, he has found a kingdom. Or he may marry on the
basis of emotional attraction. But the sympathies evoked,
the co&ouml;peration made necessary, are refining and enlarging
his life. Both these cases illustrate agencies which
are moral in their results, although not carried on from
a consciously moral purpose.</p>

<p>Suppose, however, that children are born into the family.
Then the parent consciously sets about controlling
their conduct, and in exercising authority almost inevitably
feels the need of some standard other than caprice
or selfishness. Suppose that in business the partners differ
as to their shares in the profits, then the question of
fairness is raised; and if one partner defaults, the question
of guilt. Or suppose the business encounters a law
which forbids certain operations, the problem of justice
will come to consciousness. Such situations as these are
evidently in the moral sphere in a sense in which those
of the preceding paragraph are not. They demand
some kind of judgment, some approval or disapproval.
As Aristotle says, it is not enough to do the acts; it is
necessary to do them in a certain way,&mdash;not merely to
get the result, but to intend it.  The result must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
thought of as in some sense good or right; its opposite as
in some sense bad or wrong.</p>

<p>But notice that the judgments in these cases may follow
either of two methods: (1) The parent or business
man may teach his child, or practice in business, what
tradition or the accepted standard calls for; or (2) he
may consider and examine the principles and motives
involved. Action by the first method is undoubtedly moral,
in one sense. It is judging according to a standard, though
it takes the standard for granted. Action by the second
method is moral in a more complete sense. It examines
the standard as well. The one is the method of "customary"
morality, the other that of reflective morality,
or of conscience in the proper sense.</p>

<p><b>The Three Levels and Their Motives.</b>&mdash;We may distinguish
then three levels of conduct.</p>

<p>1. Conduct arising from instincts and fundamental
needs. To satisfy these needs certain conduct is necessary,
and this in itself involves ways of acting which are
more or less rational and social. The conduct may be <i>in
accordance with</i> moral laws, though not directed by moral
judgments. We consider this level in the present chapter.</p>

<p>2. Conduct regulated by <i>standards of society</i>, for some
more or less conscious end involving the social welfare.
The level of custom, which is treated in Chapter IV.</p>

<p>3. Conduct regulated by a standard which is both
social and rational, which is examined and criticized. The
level of conscience. Progress toward this level is outlined
in Chapters V. to VIII.</p>

<p>The motives in these levels will show a similar scale.
In (1) the motives are external to the end gained. The
man seeks food, or position, or glory, or sex gratification;
he is forced to practice sobriety, industry, courage, gentleness.
In (2) the motive is to seek some good which is
social, but the man acts for the group mainly because he is
<i>of</i> the group, and does not conceive his own good as dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>tinct
from that of the group. His acts are only in part
guided by intelligence; they are in part due to habit
or accident. (3) In full morality a man not only intends
his acts definitely, he also values them as what he can
do "with all his heart." He does them <i>because</i> they are
right and good. He chooses them freely and intelligently.
Our study of moral development will consider successively
these three levels. They all exist in present morality.
Only the first two are found in savage life. If (1)
existed alone it was before the group life, which is our
starting-point in this study. We return now to our consideration
of group life, and note the actual forces which
are at work. We wish to discover the process by which
the first and second levels prepare the way for the
third.</p>

<p><b>The Necessary Activities of Existence Start the
Process.</b>&mdash;The prime necessities, if the individual is to
survive, are for food, shelter, defense against enemies.
If the stock is to survive, there must be also reproduction
and parental care. Further, it is an advantage in
the struggle if the individual can master and acquire,
can outstrip rivals, and can join forces with others of
his kind for common ends. To satisfy these needs we find
men in group life engaged in work, in war or blood feuds,
in games and festal activities, in parental care. They
are getting food and booty, making tools and houses,
conquering or enslaving their enemies, protecting the
young, winning trophies, and finding emotional excitement
in contests, dances, and songs. These all help in
the struggle for existence. But the workmen, warriors,
singers, parents, are getting more. They are forming
certain elements of character which, if not necessarily
moral in themselves, are yet indispensable requisites for
full morality. We may say therefore that nature is
doing this part of moral evolution, without the aid
of conscious intention on man's part. To use the terms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of Chapter I., we may call this a rationalizing and socializing
process, though not a conscious moral process.
We notice some of the more important agencies that are
operative.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. RATIONALIZING AGENCIES</h4>

<p><b>1. Work.</b>&mdash;The earlier forms of occupation, hunting
and fishing, call for active intelligence, although the activity
is sustained to a great degree by the immediate
interest or thrill of excitement, which makes them a recreation
to the civilized man. Quickness of perception, alertness
of mind and body, and in some cases, physical daring,
are the qualities most needed. But in the pastoral life,
and still more with the beginning of agriculture and commerce,
the man who succeeds must have foresight and
continuity of purpose. He must control impulse by reason.
He must organize those habits which are the basis
of character, instead of yielding to the attractions of
various pleasures which might lead him from the main
purpose. To a certain extent the primitive communism
acted to prevent the individual from feeling the full
force of improvidence. Even if he does not secure a supply
of game, or have a large enough flock to provide for the
necessities of himself and his immediate family, the group
does not necessarily permit him to starve. The law
"Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap" does
not press upon him with such relentless grasp as in the
modern individualistic struggle for existence. Nevertheless
it would be an entirely mistaken view of primitive
group life to suppose that it is entirely a lazy man's
paradise, or happy-go-lucky existence. The varying economic
conditions are important here as measuring the
amount of forethought and care required. It is the
shepherd Jacob whose craft outwits Esau the hunter; and
while the sympathy of the modern may be with Esau, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
must remember that forethought like other valuable
weapons may be used in a social as well as a selfish fashion.
The early Greek appreciation of craft is probably expressed
in their deification of theft and deception in
Hermes. Agriculture and commerce, still more than preceding
types of occupation, demand thoughtfulness and
the long look ahead.</p>

<p>The <i>differentiation of labor</i> has been a powerful influence
for increasing the range of mental life and stimulating
its development. If all do the same thing, all are
much alike, and inevitably remain on a low level. But
when the needs of men induce different kinds of work,
slumbering capacities are aroused and new ones are called
into being. The most deeply-rooted differentiation of
labor is that between the sexes. The woman performs
the work within or near the dwelling, the man hunts or
tends the flocks or ranges abroad. This probably tends
to accentuate further certain organic differences. Among
the men, group life in its simplest phases has little differentiation
except "for counsel" or "for war." But with
metal working and agricultural life the field widens. At
first the specializing is largely by families rather than
by individual choice. Castes of workmen may take the
place of mere kinship ties. Later on the rules of caste
in turn become a hindrance to individuality and must be
broken down if the individual is to emerge to full self-direction.</p>

<p><b>2. The Arts and Crafts.</b>&mdash;Aside from their influence as
work, the arts and crafts have a distinctly elevating and
refining effect. The textiles, pottery, and skilfully made
tools and weapons; the huts or houses when artistically
constructed; the so-called free or fine arts of dance and
music, of color and design&mdash;all have this common element:
they give some visible or audible embodiment for order or
form. The artist or craftsman must make definite his
idea in order to work it out in cloth or clay, in wood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
or stone, in dance or song. When thus embodied, it is
preserved, at least for a time. It is part of the daily
environment of the society. Those who see or hear are
having constantly suggested to them ideas and values
which bring more meaning into life and elevate its interests.
Moreover, the order, the rational plan or arrangement
which is embodied in all well-wrought objects, as well
as in the fine arts in the narrow sense, deserves emphasis.
Plato and Schiller have seen in this a valuable preparation
for morality. To govern action by law is moral, but
it is too much to expect this of the savage and the child
as a conscious principle where the law opposes impulse.
In art as in play there is direct interest and pleasure in
the act, but in art there is also order or law. In conforming
to this order the savage, or the child, is in
training for the more conscious control where the law,
instead of favoring, may thwart or oppose impulse and
desire.</p>

<p><b>3. War.</b>&mdash;War and the contests in games were serving
to work out characteristics which received also a definite social
re&euml;nforcement: namely, courage and efficiency, a sense
of power, a consciousness of achievement. All these, like
craft, may be used for unmoral or even immoral ends,
but they are also highly important as factors in an
effective moral personality.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. SOCIALIZING AGENCIES</h4>

<p><b>Co&ouml;peration and Mutual Aid.</b><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;Aside from their effects
in promoting intelligence, courage, and ideality of
life, industry, art, and war have a common factor by
which they all contribute powerfully to the social basis of
morality. They all require co&ouml;peration. They are socializing
as well as rationalizing agencies. Mutual aid is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
foundation of success. "Woe to him who stands alone, e'en
though his platter be never so full," runs the Slav proverb.
"He that belongs to no community is like unto one without
a hand." Those clans or groups which can work
together, and fight together, are stronger in the struggle
against nature and other men. The common activities
of art have value in making this community of action
more possible. Co&ouml;peration implies a common end. It
means that each is interested in the success of all. This
common end forms then a controlling rule of action, and
the mutual interest means sympathy. Co&ouml;peration is
therefore one of nature's most effective agencies for a
social standard and a social feeling.</p>

<p><b>1. Co&ouml;peration in Industry.</b>&mdash;In industry, while there
was not in primitive life the extensive exchange of goods
which expresses the interdependence of modern men, there
was yet much concerted work, and there was a great
degree of community of property. In groups which lived
by hunting or fishing, for instance, although certain kinds
of game might be pursued by the individual hunter, the
great buffalo and deer hunts were organized by the tribe
as a whole. "A hunting bonfire was kindled every morning
at daybreak at which each brave must appear and
report. The man who failed to do this before the party
set out on the day's hunt was harassed by ridicule."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Salmon fishery was also conducted as a joint undertaking.
Large game in Africa is hunted in a similar fashion, and
the product of the chase is not for the individual but for
the group. In the pastoral life the care of the flocks
and herds necessitates at least some sort of co&ouml;peration
to protect these flocks from the attacks of wild beasts and
from the more dreaded forays of human robbers. This
requires a considerable body of men, and the journeying
about in company, the sharing together of watch and
ward, the common interest in the increase of flocks and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
herds, continually strengthens the bonds between the
dwellers in tents.</p>

<p>In the agricultural stage there are still certain forces
at work which promote the family or tribal unity, although
here we begin to find the forces which make for individuality
at work until they result in individual ownership
and individual property. Just as at the pastoral
stage, so in this, the cattle and the growing grain must
be protected from attacks by man and beast. It is only
the group which can afford such protection, and accordingly
we find the Lowland farmer always at the mercy of
the Highland clan.</p>

<p><b>2. Co&ouml;peration in War.</b>&mdash;War and the blood feud,
however divisive between groups, were none the less potent
as uniting factors within the several groups. The members
must not only unite or be wiped out, when the actual
contest was on, but the whole scheme of mutual help in
defense or in avenging injuries and insults made constant
demand upon fellow feeling, and sacrifice for the good
of all. To gain more land for the group, to acquire
booty for the group, to revenge a slight done to some
member of the group, were constant causes for war.
Now although any individual might be the gainer, yet
the chances were that he would himself suffer even
though the group should win. In the case of blood
revenge particularly, most of the group were not individually
interested. Their resentment was a "sympathetic
resentment," and one author has regarded this as perhaps
the most fundamental of the sources of moral emotion.
It was because the tribal blood had been shed, or the
women of the clan insulted, that the group as a whole
reacted, and in the clash of battle with opposing groups,
was closer knit together.</p>

<p class="poem">
"Ally thyself with whom thou wilt in peace, yet know<br />
In war must every man be foe who is not kin."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">"Comrades in arms" by the very act of fighting together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
have a common cause, and by the mutual help and protection
given and received become, for the time at least, one
in will and one in heart. Ulysses counsels Agamemnon
to marshal his Greeks, clan by clan and "brotherhood
(phratry) by brotherhood," that thus brother may support
and stimulate brother more effectively; but the effect
is reciprocal, and it is indeed very probable that the
unity of blood which is believed to be the tie binding
together the members of the group, is often an afterthought
or pious fiction designed to account for the
unity which was really due originally to the stress of common
struggle.</p>

<p><b>3. Art as Socializing Agency.</b>&mdash;Co&ouml;peration and sympathy
are fostered by the activities of art. Some of these
activities are spontaneous, but most of them serve some
definite social end and are frequently organized for the
definite purpose of increasing the unity and sympathy of
the group. The hunting dance or the war dance represents,
in dramatic form, all the processes of the hunt or
fight, but it would be a mistake to suppose that this takes
place purely for dramatic purposes. The dance and celebration
after the chase or battle may give to the whole
tribe the opportunity to repeat in vivid imagination the
triumphs of the successful hunter or warrior, and thus
to feel the thrill of victory and exult in common over
the fallen prey. The dance which takes place before
the event is designed to give magical power to the hunter
or warrior. Every detail is performed with the most exact
care and the whole tribe is thus enabled to share in the
work of preparation.</p>

<p>In the act of song the same uniting force is present.
To sing with another involves a contagious sympathy,
in perhaps a higher degree than is the case with any
other art. There is, in the first place, as in the dance,
a unity of rhythm. Rhythm is based upon co&ouml;peration
and, in turn, immensely strengthens the possibility of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
co&ouml;peration. In the bas-reliefs upon the Egyptian monuments
representing the work of a large number of men
who are moving a stone, we find the sculptured figure of a
man who is beating the time for the combined efforts.
Whether all rhythm has come from the necessities of common
action or whether it has a physiological basis sufficient
to account for the effect which rhythmic action produces,
in any case when a company of people begin to
work or dance or sing in rhythmic movement, their efficiency
and their pleasure are immensely increased. In
addition to the effect of rhythm we have also in the
case of song the effect of unity of pitch and of melody,
and the members of the tribe or clan, like those who to-day
sing the Marseillaise or chant the great anthems of the
church, feel in the strongest degree their mutual sympathy
and support. For this reason, the Corroborees
of the Australian, the sacred festivals of Israel, the
Mysteries and public festivals of the Greeks, in short,
among all peoples, the common gatherings of the tribe for
patriotic or religious purposes, have been attended with
dance and song. In many cases these carry the members
on to a pitch of enthusiasm where they are ready to die
for the common cause.</p>

<p>Melodic and rhythmic sound is a unifying force simply
by reason of form, and some of the simpler songs seem
to have little else to commend them, but at very early
periods there is not merely the song but the recital, in
more or less rhythmic or literary form, of the history
of the tribe and the deeds of the ancestors. This adds
still another to the unifying forces of the dance and song.
The kindred group, as they hear the recital, live over
together the history of the group, thrill with pride at
its glories, suffer at its defeats; every member feels that
the clan's history is his history and the clan's blood his
blood.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 4. FAMILY LIFE AS AN IDEALIZING AND SOCIALIZING
AGENCY</h4>

<p>Family life, so far as it is merely on the basis of instinct,
takes its place with other agencies favored by
natural selection which make for more rational and social
existence. Various instincts are more or less at work.
The sex instinct brings the man and the woman together.
The instinct of jealousy, and the property or possessing
instinct, may foster exclusive and permanent relations.
The parental instinct and affection bind the parents together
and thus contribute to the formation of the social
group described in the preceding chapter. Considering
now the more immediate relations of husband and wife,
parents and children, rather than the more general group
relations, we call attention to some of the most obvious
aspects, leaving fuller treatment for Part III. The
idealizing influences of the sex instinct, when this is subject
to the general influences found in group life, is
familiar. Lyric song is a higher form of its manifestation,
but even a mute lover may be stimulated to fine
thoughts or brave deeds. Courtship further implies an
adaptation, an effort to please, which is a strong socializing
force. If "all the world loves a lover," it must be
because the lover is on the whole a likable r&ocirc;le. But
other forces come in. Sex love is intense, but so far as
it is purely instinctive it may be transitory. Family life
needed more permanence than sex attraction could provide,
and before the powerful sanctions of religion, society,
and morals were sufficient to secure permanence, it is
probable that the property interest of the husband was
largely effective in building up a family life, requiring
fidelity to the married relation on the part of the wife.</p>

<p>But the most far-reaching of the forces at work in
the family has been the parental instinct and affection
with its consequences upon both parents and children. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
contributes probably more than any other naturally
selected agency to the development of the race in sympathy;
it shares with work in the development of responsibility.
It is indeed one of the great incentives to industry
throughout the higher species of animals as well as in
human life. The value of parental care in the struggle
for existence is impressively presented by Sutherland.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Whereas the fishes which exercise no care for their eggs
preserve their species only by producing these in enormous
numbers, certain species which care for them maintain
their existence by producing relatively few. Many species
produce hundreds of thousands or even millions of eggs.
The stickleback, which constructs a nest and guards the
young for a few days, is one of the most numerous of
fishes, but it lays only from twenty to ninety eggs. Birds
and mammals with increased parental care produce few
young. Not only is parental care a valuable asset, it is
an absolute necessity for the production of the higher
species. "In the fierce competition of the animated forms
of earth, the loftier type, with its prolonged nervous
growth, and consequently augmented period of helplessness,
can never arise but with concomitant increases of
parental care." Only as the emotional tendency has kept
pace with the nerve development has the human race been
possible. The very refinements in the organism which
make the adult a victor would render the infant a victim
if it were without an abundance of loving assistance.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Whether, as has been supposed by some, the parental
care has also been the most effective force in keeping the
parents together through a lengthened infancy, or whether
other factors have been more effective in this particular,
there is no need to enlarge upon the wide-reaching moral
values of parental affection. It is the atmosphere in which
the child begins his experience.  So far as any environ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>ment
can affect him, this is a constant influence for sympathy
and kindness. And upon the parents themselves
its transforming power, in making life serious, in overcoming
selfishness, in projecting thought and hope on
into the future, cannot be measured. The moral order
and progress of the world might conceivably spare some
of the agencies which man has devised; it could not spare
this.</p>


<h4>&sect; 5. MORAL INTERPRETATION OF THIS FIRST LEVEL</h4>

<p>On this first level we are evidently dealing with forces
and conduct, not as moral in purpose, but as valuable
in result. They make a more rational, ideal, and social
life, and this is the necessary basis for more conscious
control and valuation of conduct. The forces are biological
or sociological or psychological. They are not
that particular kind of psychological activities which
we call moral in the proper sense, for this implies not only
getting a good result but aiming at it. Some of the
activities, such as those of song and dance, or the simpler
acts of maternal care, have a large instinctive element.
We cannot call these moral in <i>so far as</i> they are purely
instinctive. Others imply a large amount of intelligence,
as, for example, the operations of agriculture and the
various crafts. These have purpose, such as to satisfy
hunger, or to forge a weapon against an enemy. But the
end is one set up by our physical or instinctive nature.
So long as this is merely <i>accepted</i> as an end, and not
compared with others, valued, and <i>chosen</i>, it is not
properly moral.</p>

<p>The same is true of emotions. There are certain emotions
on the instinctive level. Such are parental love in
its most elemental form, sympathy as mere contagious
feeling, anger, or resentment. So far as these are at this
lowest level, so far as they signify simply a bodily thrill,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
they have no claim to proper moral value. They are tremendously
important as the source from which strong
motive forces of benevolence, intelligent parental care, and
an ardent energy against evil may draw warmth and fire.</p>

<p>Finally, even the co&ouml;peration, the mutual aid, which
men give, so far as it is called out purely by common
danger, or common advantage, is not in the moral sphere
in so far as it is instinctive, or merely give and take.
To be genuinely moral there must be some thought of
the danger as touching others and <i>therefore</i> requiring our
aid; of the advantage as being common and <i>therefore</i>
enlisting our help.</p>

<p>But even although these processes are not consciously
moral they are nevertheless fundamental. The activities
necessary for existence, and the emotions so intimately
bound up with them, are the "cosmic roots" of the moral
life. And often in the higher stages of culture, when
the codes and instruction of morality and society fail
to secure right conduct, these elementary agencies of
work, co&ouml;peration, and family life assert their power.
Society and morality take up the direction of the process
and carry it further, but they must always rely largely
on these primary activities to afford the basis for intelligent,
reliable, and sympathetic conduct.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER IV</small>

<br /><br />

GROUP MORALITY&mdash;CUSTOMS OR MORES</h2>


<p>We have seen how the natural forces of instinct
lead to activities which elevate men and knit them together.
We consider next the means which society
uses for these purposes, and the kind of conduct which
goes along with the early forms of society's agencies.
The organization of early society is that of group life,
and so far as the individual is merged in the group the
type of conduct may be called "group morality."
Inasmuch as the agencies by which the group controls its
members are largely those of custom, the morality may be
called also "customary morality." Such conduct is what
we called at the opening of the previous chapter "the second
level." It is "ethical" or "moral" in the sense of conforming
to the <i>ethos</i> or <i>mores</i> of the group.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1.  MEANING, AUTHORITY, AND ORIGIN OF CUSTOMS</h4>

<p><b>Meaning of Customs or Mores.</b>&mdash;Wherever we find
groups of men living as outlined in Chapter II., we find
that there are certain ways of acting which are common
to the group&mdash;"folkways." Some of these may be due
merely to the fact that the members are born of the same
stock, just as all ducks swim. But a large part of human
conduct, in savage as truly as in civilized life, is not merely
instinctive. There are <i>approved</i> ways of acting, common
to a group, and handed down from generation to generation.
Such approved ways of doing and acting are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
customs, or to use the Latin term, which Professor Sumner
thinks brings out more clearly this factor of approval,
they are <i>mores</i>.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> They are habits&mdash;but they are more.
They imply the judgment of the group that they are to
be followed. The welfare of the group is regarded as in
some sense imbedded in them. If any one acts contrary
to them he is made to feel the group's disapproval. The
young are carefully trained to observe them. At times
of special importance, they are rehearsed with special
solemnity.</p>

<p><b>Authority Behind the Mores.</b>&mdash;The old men, or the
priests, or medicine men, or chiefs, or old women, may
be the especial guardians of these customs. They may
modify details, or add new customs, or invent explanations
for old ones. But the authority back of them is the
group in the full sense. Not the group composed merely
of visible and living members, but the larger group which
includes the dead, and the kindred totemic or ancestral
gods. Nor is it the group considered as a collection of
individual persons. It is rather in a vague way the whole
mental and social world. The fact that most of the customs
have no known date or origin makes them seem a part
of the nature of things. Indeed there is more than a
mere analogy between the primitive regard for custom
and that respect for "Nature" which from the Stoics to
Spencer has sought a moral standard in living "according
to nature." And there is this much in favor of taking the
world of custom as the standard: the beings of this system
are like the person who is expected to behave like them;
its rules are the ways in which his own kin have lived and
prospered, and not primarily the laws of cosmic forces,
plants, and animals.</p>

<p><b>Origin of Customs; Luck.</b>&mdash;The origin of customs is
to be sought in several concurrent factors. There are in
the first place the activities induced by the great primi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>tive
needs and instincts. Some ways of acting succeed;
some fail. Man not only establishes habits of acting in
the successful ways; he remembers his failures. He hands
successful ways down with his approval; he condemns those
that fail.</p>

<p>This attitude is re&euml;nforced by the views about good luck
and bad luck. Primitive man&mdash;and civilized man&mdash;is not
ruled by a purely rational theory of success and failure.
"One might use the best known means with the greatest
care, yet fail of the result. On the other hand, one might
get a great result with no effort at all. One might
also incur a calamity without any fault of his own."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
"Grimm gives more than a thousand ancient German
apothegms, dicta, and proverbs about 'luck.'"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Both
good and bad fortune are attributed to the unseen powers,
hence a case of bad luck is not thought of as a mere
chance. If the ship that sailed Friday meets a storm,
or one of thirteen falls sick, the inference is that this is
sure to happen again. And at this point the conception
of the group welfare as bound up with the acts of every
member, comes in to make individual conformity a matter
for group concern&mdash;to make conduct a matter of mores and
not merely a private affair. One most important, if not
the most important, object of early legislation was the
enforcement of lucky rites to prevent the individual from
doing what might bring ill luck on all the tribe. For
the conception always was that the ill luck does not
attach itself simply to the doer, but may fall upon any
member of the group. "The act of one member is conceived
to make all the tribe impious, to offend its particular
god, to expose all the tribe to penalties from heaven.
When the street statues of Hermes were mutilated, all the
Athenians were frightened and furious; they thought they
should all be ruined because some one had mutilated a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
god's image and so offended him."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> "The children were
reproved for cutting and burning embers, on the ground
that this might be the cause for the accidental cutting
of some member of the family."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In the third place, besides
these sources of custom, in the usefulness or lucky
character of certain acts, there is also the more immediate
reaction of individuals or groups to certain ways of acting
according "as things jump with the feelings or displease
them."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> An act of daring is applauded, whether
useful or not. The individual judgment is caught up, repeated,
and plays its part in the formation of group opinion.
"Individual impulse and social tradition are thus
the two poles between which we move." Or there may even
be a more conscious discussion analogous to the action of
legislatures or philosophic discussion. The old men among
the Australians deliberate carefully as to each step of the
initiation ceremonies. They make customs to be handed
down.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. MEANS OF ENFORCING CUSTOMS</h4>

<p>The most general means for enforcing customs are public
opinion, taboos, ritual or ceremony, and physical force.</p>

<p><b>Public Approval</b> uses both language and form to express
its judgments. Its praise is likely to be emphasized
by some form of art. The songs that greet the returning
victor, the decorations, costumes, and tattoos for those
who are honored, serve to voice the general sentiment. On
the other hand ridicule or contempt is a sufficient penalty
to enforce compliance with many customs that may be
personally irksome. It is very largely the ridicule of the
men's house which enforces certain customs among the men
of peoples which have that institution. It is the ridicule or
scorn of both men and women which forbids the Indian to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
marry before he has proved his manhood by some notable
deed of prowess in war or chase.</p>

<p><b>Taboos.</b>&mdash;Taboos are perhaps not so much a means for
enforcing custom, as they are themselves customs invested
with peculiar and awful sanction. They prohibit or ban
any contact with certain persons or objects under penalty
of danger from unseen beings. Any events supposed
to indicate the activity of spirits, such as birth and death,
are likely to be sanctified by taboos. The danger is contagious;
if a Polynesian chief is taboo, the ordinary man
fears even to touch his footprints. But the taboos are
not all based on mere dread of the unseen.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They include such acts as have been found by experience
to produce unwelcome results.&mdash;The primitive taboos correspond
to the fact that the life of man is environed by perils:
His food quest must be limited by shunning poisonous plants.
His appetite must be restrained from excess. His physical
strength and health must be guarded from dangers. The
taboos carry on the accumulated wisdom of generations which
has almost always been purchased by pain, loss, disease, and
death. Other taboos contain inhibitions of what will be injurious
to the group. The laws about the sexes, about property,
about war, and about ghosts, have this character. They
always include some social philosophy." (<span class="smcap">Sumner</span>, <i>Folkways</i>,
pp. 33 f.)</p></div>

<p>They may be used with conscious purpose. In order
to have a supply of cocoanuts for a religious festival
the head men may place a taboo upon the young cocoanuts
to prevent them from being consumed before they
are fully ripe. The conception works in certain respects
to supply the purpose which is later subserved by ideas
of property. But it serves also as a powerful agency to
maintain respect for the authority of the group.</p>

<p><b>Ritual.</b>&mdash;As taboo is the great negative guardian of
customs, ritual is the great positive agent. It works by
forming habits, and operates through associations formed
by actually doing certain acts, usually under conditions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
which appeal to the emotions. The charm of music and of
orderly movement, the impressiveness of ordered masses
in processions, the awe of mystery, all contribute to stamp
in the meaning and value. Praise or blame encourages
or inhibits; ritual secures the actual doing and at the
same time gives a value to the doing. It is employed by
civilized peoples more in the case of military or athletic
drill, or in training children to observe forms of etiquette,
so that these may become "second nature." Certain religious
bodies also use its agency. But in primitive life
it is widely and effectively used to insure for educational,
political, and domestic customs obedience to the group
standards, which among us it secures to the codes of the
army, or to those of social etiquette. Examples of its
elaborate and impressive use will be given below under
educational ceremonies.</p>

<p><b>Physical Force.</b>&mdash;When neither group opinion, nor
taboo, nor ritual secures conformity, there is always in
the background physical force. The chiefs are generally
men of strength whose word may not be lightly disregarded.
Sometimes, as among the Sioux, the older braves
constitute a sort of police. Between different clans the
blood feud is the accepted method of enforcing custom,
unless a substitute, the wergeld, is provided. For homicide
within a clan the remaining members may drive the
slayer out, and whoever meets such a Cain may slay him.
If a man murdered his chief of kindred among the ancient
Welsh he was banished and "it was required of every
one of every sex and age within hearing of the horn
to follow that exile and to keep up the barking of dogs,
to the time of his putting to sea, until he shall have passed
three score hours out of sight."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It should be borne in
mind, however, that physical pains, either actual or
dreaded, would go but a little way toward maintaining
authority in any such group as we have regarded as typi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>cal.
Absolutism, with all its cruel methods of enforcing
terror, needs a more highly organized system. In primitive
groups the great majority support the authority of
the group as a matter of course, and uphold it as a sacred
duty when it is challenged. Physical coercion is not the
rule but the exception.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. CONDITIONS WHICH BRING OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF
GROUP STANDARDS AND RENDER GROUP CONTROL
CONSCIOUS</h4>

<p>Although customs or mores have in them an element of
social approval which makes them vehicles of moral judgment,
they tend in many cases to sink to the level of mere
habits. The reason&mdash;such as it was&mdash;for their original
force&mdash;is forgotten. They become, like many of our
forms of etiquette, mere conventions. There are, however,
certain conditions which center attention upon their importance
and lift them to the level of conscious agencies.
These conditions may be grouped under three heads. (1)
The education of the younger, immature members of the
group and their preparation for full membership. (2)
The constraint and restraint of refractory members and
the adjustment of conflicting interests. (3) Occasions
which involve some notable danger or crisis and therefore
call for the greatest attention to secure the favor of the
gods and avert disaster.</p>

<p><b>1. Educational Customs.</b>&mdash;Among the most striking
and significant of these are the initiation ceremonies which
are so widely observed among primitive peoples. They
are held with the purpose of inducting boys into the privileges
of manhood and into the full life of the group. They
are calculated at every step to impress upon the initiate
his own ignorance and helplessness in contrast with the
wisdom and power of the group; and as the mystery with
which they are conducted imposes reverence for the elders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and the authorities of the group, so the recital of the
traditions and performances of the tribe, the long series
of ritual acts, common participation in the mystic dance
and song and decorations, serve to re&euml;nforce the ties that
bind the tribe.</p>

<p>Initiation into the full privileges of manhood among the
tribes of Central Australia, for instance, includes three
sets of ceremonies which occupy weeks, and even months,
for their completion. The first set, called "throwing up
in the air," is performed for the boy when he has reached
the age of from ten to twelve. In connection with being
thrown up in the air by certain prescribed members of
his tribe, he is decorated with various totem emblems and
afterward the septum of his nose is bored for the insertion
of the nose-bone. At a period some three or four years
later a larger and more formidable series of ceremonies is
undertaken, lasting for ten days. A screen of bushes is
built, behind which the boy is kept during the whole period,
unless he is brought out on the ceremonial ground to witness
some performance. During this whole period of
ten days, he is forbidden to speak except in answer to
questions. He is decorated with various totem emblems,
for which every detail is prescribed by the council of the
tribal fathers and tribal elder brothers. He is charged to
obey every command and never to tell any woman or boy
what he may see. The sense that something out of the
ordinary is to happen to him helps to impress him strongly
with a feeling of the deep importance of compliance with
the tribal rules, and further still, with a strong sense of
the superiority of the older men who know and are familiar
with the mysterious rites of which he is about to learn the
meaning for the first time. At intervals he watches symbolic
performances of men decorated like various totem
animals, who represent the doings of the animal ancestors
of the clan; he hears mysterious sounds of the so-called
bull-roarers, which are supposed by the women and un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>initiated
to be due to unseen spirits; and the whole ends
with the operation which symbolizes his induction into
young manhood. But even this is not all; when the young
man has reached the age of discretion, when it is felt that
he can fully comprehend the traditions of the tribe, at the
age of from twenty to twenty-five, a still more impressive
series of ceremonies is conducted, which in the instance reported
lasted from September to January. This period
was filled up with dances, "corroborees," and inspection
of the churinga or sacred emblems&mdash;stones or sticks which
were supposed to be the dwellings of ancestral spirits and
which are carefully preserved in the tribe, guarded from
the sight of women and boys, but known individually
to the elders as the sacred dwelling-place of father or
grandfather. As these were shown and passed around,
great solemnity was manifest and the relatives sometimes
wept at the sight of the sacred object. Ceremonies imitating
various totem animals, frequently of the most elaborate
sort, were also performed. The young men were
told the traditions of the past history of the tribe, and
at the close of the recital they felt added reverence for the
old men who had been their instructors, a sense of pride in
the possession of this mysterious knowledge, and a deeper
unity because of what they now have in common. One is
at a loss whether to wonder most at the possibility of the
whole tribe devoting itself for three months to these elaborate
functions of initiation, or at the marvelous adaptability
of such ceremonies to train the young into an
attitude of docility and reverence. A tribe that can enforce
such a process is not likely to be wanting in one
side, at least, of the moral consciousness, namely, reverence
for authority and regard for the social welfare.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><b>2. Law and Justice.</b>&mdash;The occasions for some control
over refractory members will constantly arise, even though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the conflict between group and individual may need no
physical sanctions to enforce the authority of the group
over its members. The economic motive frequently prompts
an individual to leave the tribe or the joint family.
There was a constant tendency, Eastman states, among
his people, when on a hunting expedition in the enemy's
country, to break up into smaller parties to obtain food
more easily and freely. The police did all they could
to keep in check those parties who were intent on stealing
away. Another illustration of the same tendency is
stated by Maine with reference to the joint families of
the South Slavonians:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The adventurous and energetic member of the brotherhood
is always rebelling against its natural communism. He
goes abroad and makes his fortune, and as strenuously resists
the demands of his relatives to bring it into the common account.
Or perhaps he thinks that his share of the common
stock would be more profitably employed by him as capital
in a mercantile venture. In either case he becomes a dissatisfied
member or a declared enemy of the brotherhood."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p></div>

<p>Or covetousness might lead to violation of the ban,
as with Achan. Sex impulse may lead a man to seek for
his wife a woman not in the lawful group. Or, as one of
the most dangerous offenses possible, a member of the
group may be supposed to practice witchcraft. This is
to use invisible powers in a selfish manner, and has been
feared and punished by almost all peoples.</p>

<p>In all these cases it is of course no abstract theory of
crime which leads the community to react; it is self-preservation.
The tribe must be kept together for protection
against enemies. Achan's sin is felt to be the cause
of defeat. The violation of sex taboos may ruin the
clan. The sorcerer may cause disease, or inflict torture
and death, or bring a pestilence or famine upon the whole
group. None the less all such cases bring to conscious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>ness
one aspect of moral authority, the social control over
the individual.</p>

<p>And it is a <i>social</i> control&mdash;not an exercise of brute force
or a mere terrorizing by ghosts. For the chief or judge
generally wins his authority by his powerful service to
his tribesmen. A Gideon or Barak or Ehud or Jephthah
judged Israel because he had delivered them. "Three
things, if possessed by a man, make him fit to be a chief
of kindred: That he should speak on behalf of his kin
and be listened to, that he should fight on behalf of his
kin and be feared, and that he should be security on behalf
of his kin and be accepted."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> If, as is often the case, the
king or judge or chief regards himself as acting by divine
right, the authority is still <i>within the group</i>. It is the
group judging itself.</p>

<p>In its <i>standards</i> this primitive court is naturally on the
level of customary morality, of which it is an agent.
There is usually neither the conception of a general principle
of justice (our Common Law), nor of a positive law
enacted as the express will of the people. At first the
judge or ruler may not act by any fixed law except that
of upholding the customs. Each decision is then a special
case. A step in advance is found when the heads or
elders or priests of the tribe decide cases, not independently
of all others, but in accordance with certain precedents or
customs. A legal tradition is thus established, which,
however imperfect, is likely to be more impartial than the
arbitrary caprice of the moment, influenced as such special
decisions are likely to be by the rank or power of the
parties concerned.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> A law of precedents or tradition is
thus the normal method at this level. The progress toward
a more rational standard belongs under the next
chapter, but it is interesting to note that even at an
early age the myths show a conception of a divine judge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
who is righteous, and a divine judgment which is ideal.
Rhadamanthus is an embodiment of the demand for justice
which human collisions and decisions awakened.</p>

<p>The conscious authority of the group is also evoked in
the case of feuds or disputes between its members. The case
of the blood feud, indeed, might well be treated as belonging
under war and international law rather than as a case
of private conflict. For so far as the members of the
victim's clan are concerned, it is a case of war. It is
a patriotic duty of every kinsman to avenge the shed
blood. The groups concerned were smaller than modern
nations which go to war for similar reasons, but the principle
is the same. The chief difference in favor of modern
international wars is that since the groups are larger
they do not fight so often and require a more serious
consideration of the possibility of peaceable adjustment.
Orestes and Hamlet feel it a sacred duty to avenge their
fathers' murders.</p>

<p>But the case is not simply that of clan against clan.
For the smaller group of kin, who are bound to avenge,
are nearly always part of a larger group. And the larger
group may at once recognize the duty of vengeance and
also the need of keeping it within bounds, or of substituting
other practices. The larger group may see in the
murder a pollution, dangerous to all;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the blood which
"cries from the ground"<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> renders the ground "unclean"
and the curse of gods or the spirits of the dead may
work woe upon the whole region. But an unending blood
feud is likewise an evil. And if the injured kin can be appeased
by less than blood in return, so much the better.
Hence the wergeld, or indemnity, a custom which persisted
among the Irish until late, and seemed to the English
judges a scandalous procedure.</p>

<p>For lesser offenses a sort of regulated duel is sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
allowed. For example, among the Australians the incident
is related of the treatment of a man who had eloped
with his neighbor's wife. When the recreant parties returned
the old men considered what should be done, and
finally arranged the following penalty. The offender
stood and called out to the injured husband, "I stole your
woman; come and growl." The husband then proceeded to
throw a spear at him from a distance, and afterwards to
attack him with a knife, although he did not attempt to
wound him in a vital part. The offender was allowed
to evade injury, though not to resent the attack. Finally
the old men said, "Enough." A curious form of private
agencies for securing justice is also found in the Japanese
custom of hara-kiri, according to which an injured man
kills himself before the door of his offender, in order that
he may bring public odium upon the man who has injured
him. An Indian custom of Dharna is of similar significance,
though less violent. The creditor fasts before the
door of the debtor until he either is paid, or dies of starvation.
It may be that he thinks that his double or spirit
will haunt the cruel debtor who has thus permitted him
to starve to death, but it also has the effect of bringing
public opinion to bear.</p>

<p>In all these cases of kindred feuds there is little
personal responsibility, and likewise little distinction between
the accidental and intentional. These facts are
brought out in the opening quotations in Chapter II. The
important thing for the student to observe is that like
our present practices in international affairs they show a
<i>grade</i> of morality, a limited social unity, whether it is
called kinship feeling or patriotism; complete morality is
not possible so long as there is no complete way of settling
disputes by justice instead of force.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p><b>3. Occasions Which Involve Some Special Danger or
Crisis.</b>&mdash;Such occasions call for the greatest attention
to secure success or avoid disaster. Under this head we
note as typical (a) the occasions of birth, marriage,
death; (b) seed time and harvest, or other seasons important
for the maintenance of the group; (c) war; (d)
hospitality.</p>

<p><b>(a) Birth and Death Customs.</b>&mdash;The entrance of a
new life into the world and the disappearance of the animating
breath (<i>spiritus</i>, <i>anima</i>, <i>psyche</i>), might well impress
man with the mysteries of his world. Whether the
newborn infant is regarded as a reincarnation of an
ancestral spirit as with the Australians, or as a new creation
from the spirit world as with the Kafirs, it is a time
of danger. The mother must be "purified,"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> the child,
and in some cases the father, must be carefully guarded.
The elaborate customs show the group judgment of the
importance of the occasion. And the rites for the dead
are yet more impressive. For as a rule the savage has no
thought of an entire extinction of the person. The dead
lives on in some mode, shadowy and vague, perhaps, but
he is still potent, still a member of the group, present
at the tomb or the hearth. The preparation of the body
for burial or other disposition, the ceremonies of interment
or of the pyre, the wailing, and mourning costumes,
the provision of food and weapons, or of the favorite
horse or wife, to be with the dead in the unseen world, the
perpetual homage paid&mdash;all these are eloquent. The event,
as often as it occurs, appeals by both sympathy and awe
to the common feeling, and brings to consciousness the
unity of the group and the control exercised by its
judgments.</p>

<p>The regulations for marriage are scarcely less important;
indeed, they are often seemingly the most important
of the customs. The phrases "marriage by capture" and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
"marriage by purchase," are quite misleading if they give
the impression that in early culture any man may have
any woman. It is an almost universal part of the clan
system that the man must marry out of his own clan or
totem (exogamy), and it is frequently specified exactly
into what other clan he must marry. Among some the
regulations are minute as to which of the age classes, as
well as to which of the kin groups, a man of specific group
must choose from. The courtship may follow different
rules from ours, and the relation of the sexes in certain
respects may seem so loose as to shock the student, but
the regulation is in many respects stricter than with
us, and punishment of its violation often severer. There
can be no doubt of the meaning of the control, however mistaken
some of its features. Whether the regulations for
exogamy, which provide so effectually for avoiding incest,
are reinforced by an instinctive element of aversion to sex
relations with intimates, is uncertain; in any case, they are
enforced by the strongest taboos. Nor does primitive society
stop with the negative side. The actual marriage is
invested with the social values and religious sanctions which
raise the relation to a higher level. Art, in garments and
ornament, in dance and epithalamium, lends ideal values.
The sacred meal at the encircled hearth secures the participation
of the kindred gods.</p>

<p><b>(b) Certain Days or Seasons Important for the Industrial
Life.</b>&mdash;Seed time and harvest, the winter and summer
solstices, the return of spring, are of the highest
importance to agricultural and pastoral peoples, and are
widely observed with solemn rites. Where the rain is
the center of anxiety, a whole ritual may arise in connection
with it, as among the Zu&ntilde;i Indians. Ceremonies
lasting days, involving the preparation of special symbols
of clouds and lightning, and the participation of
numerous secret fraternities, constrain the attention of
all. Moreover, this constraint of need, working through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the conception of what the gods require, enforces some
very positive moral attitudes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A Zu&ntilde;i must speak with one tongue (sincerely) in order to
have his prayers received by the gods, and unless his prayers
are accepted no rains will come, which means starvation. He
must be gentle, and he must speak and act with kindness to all,
for the gods care not for those whose lips speak harshly. He
must observe continence four days previous to, and four days
following, the sending of breath prayers through the spiritual
essence of plume offerings, and thus their passions are brought
under control." (<span class="smcap">Mrs. M. C. Stevenson</span> in 23d Report,
<i>Bureau of Ethnology</i>.)</p></div>

<p>Phases of the moon give other sacred days. Sabbaths
which originally are negative&mdash;the forbidding of labor&mdash;may
become later the bearers of positive social and spiritual
value. In any case, all these festivals bring the group
authority to consciousness, and by their ritual promote
the intimate group sympathy and consciousness of a common
end.</p>

<p><b>(c) War.</b>&mdash;War as a special crisis always brings out
the significance and importance of certain customs. The
deliberations, the magic, the war paint which precede, the
obedience compelled by it to chiefs, the extraordinary
powers exercised by the chief or heads at such crises, the
sense of danger which strains the attention, all insure
attention. No carelessness is permitted. Defeat is interpreted
as a symbol of divine anger because of a violated
law or custom. Victory brings all together to celebrate
the glory of the clan and to mourn in common the warriors
slain in the common cause. Excellence here may be so
conspicuous in its service, or in the admiration it calls
out, as to become a general term for what the group
approves. So the <i>aret&#275;</i> of the Greeks became their general
term, and the Latin <i>virtus</i>, if not so clearly military,
was yet largely military in its early coloring. The "spirit
of Jehovah," the symbol of divine approval and so of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
group approval, was believed to be with Samson and Jephthah
in their deeds of prowess in Israel's behalf.</p>

<p><b>(d) Hospitality.</b>&mdash;To the modern man who travels without
fear and receives guests as a matter of almost daily
practice, it may seem strained to include hospitality along
with unusual or critical events. But the ceremonies observed
and the importance attached to its rites, show that
hospitality was a matter of great significance; its customs
were among the most sacred.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But as for us," says Ulysses to the Cyclops, "we have
lighted here, and come to these thy knees, if perchance they
will give us a stranger's gift, or make any present, as is the
due of strangers. Nay, lord, have regard to the gods, for we
are thy suppliants, and Zeus is the avenger of suppliants and
sojourners, Zeus, the god of the stranger, who fareth in the
company of reverend strangers."</p></div>

<p>The duty of hospitality is one of the most widely
recognized. Westermarck has brought together a series
of maxims from a great variety of races which show this
forcibly.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Indians, Kalmucks, Greeks, Romans, Teutons,
Arabs, Africans, Ainos, and other peoples are drawn upon
and tell the same story. The stranger is to be respected
sacredly. His person must be guarded from insult even
if the honor of the daughter of the house must be sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
"Jehovah preserveth the sojourners," and they
are grouped with the fatherless and the widow in Israel's
law.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The Romans had their <i>dii hospitales</i> and the "duties
toward a guest were even more stringent than those toward
a relative"&mdash;<i>primum tutel&aelig;</i>, <i>delude hospiti</i>, <i>deinde clienti</i>,
<i>tum cognato</i>, <i>postea affini</i>.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> "He who has a spark of
caution in him," says Plato, "will do his best to pass
through life without sinning against the stranger." And
there is no doubt that this sanctity of the guest's person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
was not due to pure kindness. The whole conduct of group
life is opposed to a general spirit of consideration for
those outside. The word "guest" is akin to <i>hostis</i>, from
which comes "hostile." The stranger or the guest was
looked upon rather as a being who was specially potent.
He was a "live wire." He might be a medium of blessing,
or he might be a medium of hurt. But it was highly
important to fail in no duty toward him. The definite
possibility of entertaining angels unawares might not be
always present to consciousness, but there seems reason to
believe that the possibility of good luck or bad luck
as attending on a visitor was generally believed in. It is
also plausible that the importance attached to sharing a
meal, or to bodily contact, is based on magical ideas of
the way in which blessing or curse may be communicated.
To cross a threshold or touch a tent-rope or to eat "salt,"
gives a sacred claim. In the right of asylum, the refugee
takes advantage of his contact with the god. He lays
hold of the altar and assumes that the god will protect
him. The whole practice of hospitality is thus the converse
of the custom of blood revenge. They are alike sacred&mdash;or
rather the duty of hospitality may protect even the man
whom the host is bound to pursue. But, whereas the one
makes for group solidarity by acts of exclusive and hostile
character, the other tends to set aside temporarily the
division between the "we-group" and the "others-group."
Under the sanction of religion it keeps open a way of communication
which trade and other social interchange will
widen. It adds to family and the men's house a powerful
agency in maintaining at least the possibility of humaneness
and sympathy.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4. VALUES AND DEFECTS OF CUSTOMARY MORALITY</h4>

<p>These have been suggested, in the main, in the description
of the nature of custom and its regulation of conduct.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
We may, however, summarize them as a preparation for
the next stage of morality.</p>

<p><b>1. The Forming of Standards.</b>&mdash;There is a standard,
a "good," a "right," which is to some degree rational
and to some degree social. We have seen that custom rests
in part on rational conceptions of welfare. It is really
nothing against this that a large element of luck enters
into the idea of welfare. For this means merely that the
actual conditions of welfare are not understood. The next
generation may be able to point out as equally absurd our
present ignorance about health and disease. The members
of the group embodied in custom what they thought
to be important; they were approving some acts and forbidding
or condemning others; they were using the elders,
and the wisdom of all the past, in order to govern life.
So far, then, they were acting morally. They were also,
to a degree, using a rational and social standard when they
made custom binding on all, and conceived its origin as
immemorial. When further they conceived it as approved
by the gods, they gave it all the value they knew how to
put into it.</p>

<p>The standards and valuations of custom are, however,
only partly rational. Many customs are irrational; some
are injurious. But in them all the habitual is a large,
if not the largest, factor. And this is often strong enough
to resist any attempt at rational testing. Dr. Arthur
Smith tells us of the advantage it would be in certain parts
of China to build a door on the south side of the house
in order to get the breeze in hot weather. The simple
and sufficient answer to such a suggestion is, "We don't
build doors on the south side."</p>

<p>An additional weakness in the character of such irrational,
or partly rational standards, is the misplaced energy
they involve. What is merely trivial is made as important
and impressive as what has real significance.
Tithing mint, anise, and cummin is quite likely to involve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
neglect of the weightier matters of the law. Moral life
requires men to estimate the value of acts. If the irrelevant
or the petty is made important, it not only prevents
a high level of value for the really important act,
it loads up conduct with burdens which keep it back;
it introduces elements which must be got rid of later, often
with heavy loss of what is genuinely valuable. When there
are so many ways of offending the gods and when these
turn so often upon mere observance of routine or formula,
it may require much subsequent time and energy to make
amends. The morals get an expiatory character.</p>

<p><b>2. The Motives.</b>&mdash;In the motives to which it appeals,
custom is able to make a far better showing than earlier
writers, like Herbert Spencer, gave it credit for. It doubtless
employs fear in its taboos; it doubtless enlists the
passion of resentment in its blood feuds. Even these are
modified by a social environment. For the fear of violating
a taboo is in part the fear of bringing bad luck
on the whole group, and not merely on the violator. We
have, therefore, a quasi-social fear, not a purely instinctive
reaction. The same is true in perhaps a stronger
degree of the resentments. The blood revenge is in a
majority of cases not a personal but a group affair. It
is undertaken at personal risk and for others' interest&mdash;or
rather for a common interest. The resentment is thus a
"<i>sympathetic resentment</i>."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Regarded as a mere reaction
for self-preservation this instinctive-emotional process is
unmoral. As a mere desire to produce pain it would be immoral.
But so far as it implies an attitude of reacting
from a general point of view and to aid others, it is moral.
Aside from the passions of fear and resentment, however,
there is a wide range of motives enlisted. Filial and parental
affection, some degree of affection between the sexes
over and above sex passion, respect for the aged and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
beings who embody ideals however crude, loyalty to fellow
clansmen,&mdash;all these are not only fostered but actually secured
by the primitive group. But the motives which
imply reflection&mdash;reverence for duty as the imperious law
of a larger life, sincere love of what is good for its
own sake&mdash;cannot be brought to full consciousness until
there is a more definite conception of a moral authority, a
more definite contrast between the one great good and the
partial or temporary satisfactions. The development of
these conceptions requires a growth in individuality; it
requires conflicts between authority and liberty, and those
collisions between private interests and the public welfare
which a higher civilization affords.</p>

<p><b>3. The Content.</b>&mdash;When we consider the "what" of
group and customary morality we note at once that the
factors which make for the idealizing and expansion of interests
are less in evidence than those which make for a common
and social interest and satisfaction. There is indeed, as
we have noted, opportunity for memory and fancy. The
traditions of the past, the myths, the cultus, the folk songs&mdash;these
keep up a mental life which is as genuinely valued
as the more physical activities. But as the mode of life in
question does not evoke the more abstractly rational activities&mdash;reasoning,
selecting, choosing&mdash;in the highest degree,
the ideals lack reach and power. It needs the incentives
described in the following chapters to call out a true
life of the spirit. The social aspects of the "what," on the
other hand, are well rooted in group morality. It is unnecessary
to repeat what has been dwelt upon in the
present and preceding chapters so fully. We point out now
that while the standard is social, it is unconsciously rather
than consciously social. Or perhaps better: it is a standard
of society but not a standard which each member deliberately
makes his own. He takes it as a matter of course.
He is in the clan, "with the gang"; he thinks and acts
accordingly. He cannot begin to be as selfish as a modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
individualist; he simply hasn't the imagery to conceive such
an exclusive good, nor the tools with which to carry it out.
But he cannot be as broadly social either. He may not be
able to sink so low as the civilized miser, or debauchee, or
criminal, but neither can he conceive or build up the character
which implies facing opposition. The moral hero
achieves full stature only when he pits himself against
others, when he recognizes evil and fights it, when he "overcomes
the world."</p>

<p><b>4. Organization of Character.</b>&mdash;In the organization of
stable character the morality of custom is strong on one
side. The group trains its members to act in the ways it
approves and afterwards holds them by all the agencies in
its power. It forms habits and enforces them. Its weakness
is that the element of habit is so large, that of freedom
so small. It holds up the average man; it holds back
the man who might forge ahead. It is an anchor, and a
drag.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER V</small>

<br /><br />

FROM CUSTOM TO CONSCIENCE; FROM GROUP
MORALITY TO PERSONAL MORALITY</h2>


<h4>&sect; 1. CONTRAST AND COLLISION</h4>

<p><b>1. What the Third Level Means.</b>&mdash;Complete morality
is reached only when the individual recognizes the right or
chooses the good freely, devotes himself heartily to its fulfillment,
and seeks a progressive social development in which
every member of society shall share. The group morality
with its agencies of custom set up a standard, but one that
was corporate rather than personal. It approved and disapproved,
that is it had an idea of good, but this did not
mean a good that was personally valued. It enlisted its
members, but it was by drill, by pleasure and pain, and by
habit, rather than by fully voluntary action. It secured
steadiness by habit and social pressure, rather than by
choices built into character. It maintained community of
feeling and action, but of the unconscious rather than the
definitely social type. Finally it was rather fitted to maintain
a fixed order than to promote and safeguard progress.
Advance then must (1) substitute some rational method of
setting up standards and forming values, in place of habitual
passive acceptance; (2) secure voluntary and personal
choice and interest, instead of unconscious identification
with the group welfare, or instinctive and habitual response
to group needs; (3) encourage at the same time individual
development and the demand that all shall share in this
development&mdash;the worth and happiness of the person and
of <i>every</i> person.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p><b>2. Collisions Involved.</b>&mdash;Such an advance brings
to consciousness two collisions. The oppositions were
there before, but they were not felt as oppositions. So
long as the man was fully with his group, or satisfied
with the custom, he would make no revolt. When the
movement begins the collisions are felt. These collisions
are:</p>

<p>(1) The collision between the authority and interests of
the group, and the independence and private interests of
the individual.</p>

<p>(2) The collision between order and progress, between
habit and reconstruction or reformation.</p>

<p>It is evident that there is a close connection between
these two collisions; in fact, the second becomes in practice
a form of the first. For we saw in the last chapter that
custom is really backed and enforced by the group, and its
merely habitual parts are as strongly supported as those
parts which have a more rational basis. It would perhaps
be conceivable that a people should move on all together,
working out a higher civilization in which free thought
should keep full reverence for social values, in which political
liberty should keep even pace with the development of
government, in which self-interest should be accompanied
by regard for the welfare of others, just as it may be possible
for a child to grow into full morality without a period
of "storm and stress." But this is not usual. Progress
has generally cost struggle. And the first phase of this
struggle is opposition between the individual and the
group. The self-assertive instincts and impulses were present
in group life, but they were in part undeveloped because
they had not enough stimulus to call them out. A man
could not develop his impulse for possession to its full extent
if there was little or nothing for him to possess. In
part they were not developed because the group held them
back, and the conditions of living and fighting favored
those groups which did keep them back. Nevertheless they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
were present in some degree, always contending against the
more social forces. Indeed what makes the opposition between
group and individual so strong and so continuous is
that both the social and the individual are rooted in human
nature. They constitute what Kant calls the <i>unsocial sociableness</i>
of man. "Man cannot get on with his fellows and
he cannot do without them."</p>

<p><b>Individualism.</b>&mdash;The assertion by the individual of his
own opinions and beliefs, his own independence and interests,
as over against group standards, authority, and interests,
is known as individualism. It is evident that such
assertion will always mark a new level of conduct. Action
must now be personal and voluntary. It is also evident
that it may be either better or worse than the level of custom
and group life. The first effect is likely to be, in appearance
at least, a change for the worse. The old restraints are
tossed aside; "creeds outworn" no longer steady or direct;
the strong or the crafty individual comes to the fore and
exploits his fellows. Every man does what is "right in his
own eyes." The age of the Sophists in Greece, of the Renaissance
in Italy, of the Enlightenment and Romantic
movement in western Europe, and of the industrial revolution
in recent times illustrate different phases of individualism.
A people, as well as an individual, may "go to
pieces" in its reaction against social authority and custom.
But such one-sided individualism is almost certain to call
out prophets of a new order; "organic filaments" of new
structures appear; family, industry, the state, are organized
anew and upon more voluntary basis. Those who accept
the new conditions and assume responsibility with
their freedom, who direct their choices by reason instead of
passion, who "aim at justice and kindness" as well as at
happiness, become moral persons and gain thereby new
worth and dignity. While, then, the general movement is on
the whole a movement of individualism, it demands just as
necessarily, if there is to be moral progress, a <i>recon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>structed
individual</i>&mdash;a person who is individual in choice,
in feeling, in responsibility, and at the same time social in
what he regards as good, in his sympathies, and in his purposes.
Otherwise individualism means progress toward the
immoral.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. SOCIOLOGICAL AGENCIES IN THE TRANSITION</h4>

<p>The agencies which bring about the change from customary
and group morality to conscious and personal
morality are varied. Just as character is developed in
the child and young man by various means, sometimes
by success, sometimes by adversity or loss of a parent,
sometimes by slow increase in knowledge, and sometimes
by a sudden right-about-face with a strong emotional basis,
so it is with peoples. Some, like the Japanese at the present,
are brought into sudden contact with the whole set of
commercial and military forces from without. Among
others, as with the Greeks, a fermentation starts within,
along intellectual, economic, political, and religious lines.
Or again, national calamities may upset all the old values,
as with the Hebrews. But we may note four typical agencies
which are usually more or less active.</p>

<p><b>1. Economic Forces.</b>&mdash;The action of economic forces in
breaking up the early kinship group or joint family may
be noticed in the history of many peoples. The clan flourishes
in such conditions of hunting life or of simple agriculture
as were found among Australians and Indians, or
among the Celts in Ireland and the Scottish Highlands.
It cannot survive when a more advanced state of agriculture
prevails. A certain amount of individualism will appear
wherever the advantage for the individual lies in separate
industry and private ownership. If buffalo was to
be hunted it was better to pool issues, but for smaller game
the skilful or persistent huntsman or shepherd will think
he can gain more by working for himself. This is intensi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>fied
when agriculture and commerce take the place of
earlier modes of life. The farmer has to work so hard and
long, his goal is so far in the future, that differences of
character show themselves much more strongly. Hunting
and fishing are so exciting, and the reward is so near, that
even a man who is not very industrious will do his part.
But in agriculture only the hard and patient worker gets
a reward and he does not like to share it with the lazy, or
even with the weaker. Commerce, bargaining, likewise puts
a great premium on individual shrewdness. And for a
long time commerce was conducted on a relatively individual
basis. Caravans of traders journeyed together for
mutual protection but there was not any such organization
as later obtained, and each individual could display
his own cunning or ability. Moreover commerce leads to
the comparison of custom, to interchange of ideas as well
as goods. All this tends to break down the sanctity of
customs peculiar to a given group. The trader as well as
the guest may overstep the barriers set up by kin. The
early Greek colonists, among whom a great individualistic
movement began, were the traders of their day. The parts
of Europe where most survives of primitive group life are
those little touched by modern commerce.</p>

<p>But we get a broader view of economic influences if we
consider the methods of organizing industry which have
successively prevailed. In early society, and likewise in
the earlier period of modern civilization, the family was a
great economic unit. Many or most of the industries could
be advantageously carried on in the household. As in the
cases cited above (p. 60) the stronger or adventurous member
would be constantly trying to strike out for himself.
This process of constant readjustment is, however, far less
thoroughgoing in its effects on mores than the three great
methods of securing a broader organization of industry.
In primitive society large enterprises had to be carried on
by the co-operation of the group. Forced labor as used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
by the Oriental civilizations substituted a method by which
greater works like the pyramids or temples could be built,
but it brought with it the overthrow of much of the old
group sympathies and mutual aid. In Greece and Rome
slavery did the drudgery and left the citizens free to cultivate
art, letters, and government. It gave opportunity
and scope for the few. Men of power and genius arose,
and at the same time all the negative forces of individualism
asserted themselves. In modern times capitalism is the
method for organizing industry and trade. It proves
more effective than forced labor or slavery in securing
combination of forces and in exploiting natural resources.
It likewise gives extraordinary opportunities for the rise
of men of organizing genius. The careers of "captains
of industry" are more fascinating than those of old-time
conquerors because they involve more complex situations,
and can utilize the discoveries and labors of more men. But
modern capitalism has been as destructive to the morality
of the Middle Ages, or even of a hundred years ago, as
was forced labor or slavery to the group life and mores
which they destroyed.</p>

<p><b>2. The Progress of Science and the Arts.</b>&mdash;The effect
of the progress of science and intelligence upon the mores
is direct. Comparisons of the customs of one people with
those of another bring out differences, and arouse questions
as to the reasons for such diversity. And we have
seen that there is more or less in the customs for which no
reason can be given. Even if there was one originally
it has been forgotten. Or again, increasing knowledge of
weather and seasons, of plants and animals, of sickness
and disease, discredits many of the taboos and ceremonials
which the cruder beliefs had regarded as essential
to welfare. Certain elements of ritual may survive under
the protection of "mysteries," but the more enlightened
portion of the community keeps aloof. Instead of the
mores with their large infusion of the accidental, the ha<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>bitual,
and the impulsive, increasing intelligence demands
some rational rule of life.</p>

<p>And science joins with the various industrial and fine
arts to create a new set of interests for the individual.
Any good piece of workmanship, any work of art however
simple, is twice blest. It blesses him that makes and him
that uses or enjoys. The division of labor, begun in group
life, is carried further. Craftsmen and artists develop
increasing individuality as they construct temples or palaces,
fashion statues or pottery, or sing of gods and heroes.
Their minds grow with what they do. Side by side with
the aspect of art which makes it a bond of society is the
aspect which so frequently makes the skilled workman the
critic, and the artist a law to himself. In the next place
note the effect on those who can use and enjoy the products
of the arts. A new world of satisfaction and happiness is
opened which each person can enter for himself. In cruder
conditions there was not much out of which to build up
happiness. Food, labor, rest, the thrill of hunt or contest,
the passion of sex, the pride in children&mdash;these made up the
interests of primitive life. Further means of enjoyment were
found chiefly in society of the kin, or in the men's house.
But as the arts advanced the individual could have made
for him a fine house and elaborate clothing. Metal, wood,
and clay minister to increasing wants. A permanent and
stately tomb makes the future more definite. The ability
to hand down wealth in durable form places a premium on
its acquirement. Ambition has more stuff to work with.
A more definite, assertive self is gradually built up.
"Good" comes to have added meaning with every new
want that awakes. The individual is not satisfied any
longer to take the group's valuation. He wants to get his
own good in his own way. And it will often seem to him
that he can get his own good most easily and surely
either by keeping out of the common life or by using
his fellow men to his own advantage.  Men of culture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
have frequently shown their selfishness in the first way;
men of wealth in the second. An aristocracy of culture,
or birth, or wealth may come to regard the whole
process of civilization as properly ministering to the wants
of the select few. Nearly every people which has developed
the arts and sciences has developed also an aristocracy.
In the ancient world slavery was a part of the process. In
modern times other forms of exploitation may serve the
purpose better. Individualism, released from the ties
which bound up the good of one with the good of all, tends
to become exclusive and selfish; civilization with all its opportunities
for increasing happiness and increasing life
has its moral risks and indirectly, at least, its moral evils.</p>

<p>These evils may appear as the gratification of sense and
appetite and thus may be opposed to the higher life of the
spirit, which needs no outer objects or luxuries. Or they
may appear as rooted in selfishness, in the desire for gratifying
the exclusive self of material interests or ambition,
as over against sympathy, justice, and kindness, which
mark a broadly human and social life. In both cases serious
men have sought to overcome by some form of "self-denial"
the evils that attend on civilization, even if they are
not due to it.</p>

<p><b>3. Military Forces.</b>&mdash;The kinship group is a protection
so long as it has to contend only with similar groups. The
headlong valor and tribal loyalty of German or Scottish
clans may even win conflicts with more disciplined troops
of Rome or England. But permanent success demands
higher organization than the old clans and tribes permitted.
Organization means authority, and a single directing,
controlling commander or king. As Egypt, Assyria,
Ph&#339;nicia show their strength the clans of Israel cry, "Nay,
but we will have a king over us; that we may also be like all
the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out
before us, and fight our battles."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Wars afford the oppor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>tunity
for the strong and unscrupulous leader to assert
himself. Like commerce they may tend also to spread culture
and thus break down barriers of ancient custom. The
conquests of Babylon and Alexander, the Crusades and the
French Revolution, are instances of the power of military
forces to destroy old customs and give individualism new
scope. In most cases, it is true, it is only the leader or "tyrant"
who gets the advantage. He uses the whole machinery
of society for his own elevation. Nevertheless
custom and group unity are broken for all. Respect for
law must be built new from the foundation.</p>

<p><b>4. Religious Forces.</b>&mdash;While in general religion is a
conservative agency, it is also true that a new religion or
a new departure in religion has often exercised a powerful
influence on moral development. The very fact that religion
is so intimately bound up with all the group mores
and ideals, makes a change in religion bear directly on
old standards of life. The collision between old and new
is likely to be fundamental and sharp. A conception of
God may carry with it a view of what conduct is pleasing
to him. A doctrine as to the future may require a certain
mode of life. A cultus may approve or condemn certain
relations between the sexes. Conflicting religions may then
force a moral attitude in weighing their claims. The contests
between Jehovah and Baal, between Orphic cults and
the public Greek religion, between Judaism and Christianity,
Christianity and Roman civilization, Christianity
and Germanic religion, Catholicism and Protestantism,
have brought out moral issues. We shall notice this factor
especially in Chapters VI. and VIII.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AGENCIES</h4>

<p>The psychological forces which tend toward individualism
have been already stated to be the self-assertive instincts
and impulses. They are all variations of the effort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of the living being first to preserve itself and then to rise
to more complicated life by entering into more complex
relations and mastering its environment. Spinoza's "<i>sui
esse conservare</i>," Schopenhauer's "will to live," Nietzsche's
"will to power," the Hebrew's passionate ideal of "life",
and Tennyson's "More life, and fuller" express in varying
degree the meaning of this elemental bent and process.
Growing intelligence adds to its strength by giving
greater capacity to control. Starting with organic needs,
this developing life process may find satisfactions in
the physical world in the increasing power and mastery
over nature gained by the explorer or the hunter, the discoverer,
the craftsman, or the artist. It is when it enters
the world of persons that it displays a peculiar intensity
that marks the passions of individualism <i>par excellence</i>.
We note four of these tendencies toward self-assertion.</p>

<p><b>1. Sex.</b>&mdash;The sex instinct and emotion occupies a peculiar
position in this respect. On the one hand it is a
powerful socializing agency. It brings the sexes together
and is thus fundamental to the family. But on the other
hand it is constantly rebelling against the limits and conventions
established by the social group for its regulation.
The statutes against illicit relations, from the codes of
Hammurabi and Moses to the latest efforts for stricter
divorce, attest the collision between the individual's inclination
and the will of the group. Repeatedly some passion
of sex has broken over all social, legal, and religious sanctions.
It has thus been a favorite theme of tragedy from
the Greeks to Ibsen. It finds another fitting medium in
the romance. It has called into existence and maintains
in every large city an outcast colony of wretched creatures,
and the evils which attend are not limited in their results
to those who knowingly take the risks. It has worked repeated
changes in the structure of the family authorized
by society. Its value and proper regulation were points
at issue in that wide-reaching change of mores attendant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
upon the Reformation, and apparently equilibrium has not
yet been reached.</p>

<p><b>2. The Demand for Possession and Private Property.</b>&mdash;In
the primitive group we have seen that there might be
private property in tools or weapons, in cattle or slaves.
There was little private property in land under the maternal
clan; and indeed in any case, so long as the arts were
undeveloped, private property had necessary limits. The
demand for private property is a natural attendant upon
individual modes of industry. As we have said, it was a
common principle that what the group produced was owned
by the group, and what the individual made or captured
was treated as his. When individual industry came to
count for more, the individual claimed more and more as
private possession.</p>

<p>The change from the maternal clan to the paternal
family or household was a re&euml;nforcement to the individual
control of property. The father could hand down his cattle
or his house to his son. The joint family of India is
indeed a type of a paternal system. Nevertheless the
tendency is much stronger to insist on individual property
where the father's goods pass to his son than where they go
to his sister's children.</p>

<p>The chiefs or rulers were likely to gain the right of private
property first. Among certain families of the South
Slavs to-day, the head has his individual eating utensils,
the rest share. Among many people the chiefs have cattle
which they can dispose of as they will; the rest have simply
their share of the kin's goods. The old Brehon laws of
Ireland show this stage.</p>

<p>But however it comes about, the very meaning of property
is, in the first place, exclusion of others from some
thing which I have. It is therefore in so far necessarily
opposed to group unity, opposed to any such simple solidarity
of life as we find in group morality. As the American
Indian accepts land in severalty, the old group life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the tribal restraints and supports, the group custom and
moral unity that went with it, are gone. He must find a
new basis or go to pieces.</p>

<p><b>3. Struggles for Mastery or Liberty.</b>&mdash;In most cases
these cannot be separated from economic struggles. Masters
and slaves were in economic as well as personal relations,
and nearly all class contests on a large scale have
had at least one economic root, whatever their other
sources. But the economic is not their only root. There
have been wars for glory or for liberty as well as for
territory or booty or slaves. As the struggle for existence
has bred into the race the instinct of self-defense
with its emotion of anger, the instinct to rivalry and
mastery, and the corresponding aversion to being ruled,
so the progress of society shows trials of strength between
man and man, kin and kin, tribe and tribe. And while,
as stated in the preceding chapter, the co&ouml;peration made
necessary in war or feud is a uniting force, there is
another side to the story. Contests between individuals
show who is master; contests between groups tend to
bring forward leaders. And while such masterful men
may serve the group they are quite as likely to find
an interest in opposing group customs. They assert an
independence of the group, or a mastery over it, quite incompatible
with the solidarity of the kinship clan, although
the patriarchal type of household under a strong head
may be quite possible. There comes to be one code for
rich and another for poor, one for Patricians and another
for Plebs, one for baron and another for peasant, one for
gentry and another for the common folk. For a time this
may be accepted patiently. But when once the rich become
arrogant, the feudal lord insolent, the bitter truth is faced
that the customs have become mere conventions. They no
longer hold. All the old ties are cast off. The demand for
freedom and equality rises, and the collision between authority
and liberty is on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Or the contest may be for intellectual liberty&mdash;for free
thought and free speech. It is sometimes considered that
such liberty meets its strongest opponent in the religious
or ecclesiastical organization. There is no doubt a conservative
tendency in religion. As we have pointed out,
religion is the great conservator of group values and group
standards. Its ritual is most elaborate, its taboos most
sacred. Intellectual criticism tends to undermine what is
outgrown or merely habitual here as elsewhere. Rationalism
or free thought has set itself in frequent opposition
likewise to what has been claimed to be "above reason."
Nevertheless it would be absurd to attribute all the individualism
to science and all the conservatism to religion.
Scientific dogmas and "idols" are hard to displace. Schools
are about as conservative as churches. And on the other
hand the struggle for religious liberty has usually been
carried on not by the irreligious but by the religious. The
prophet Amos found himself opposed by the religious organization
of his day when he urged social righteousness,
and the history of the noble army of martyrs is a record
of appeal to individual conscience, or to an immediate personal
relation to God, as over against the formal, the traditional,
the organized religious customs and doctrines of
their age. The struggle for religious toleration and religious
liberty takes its place side by side with the struggles
for intellectual and political liberty in the chapters
of individualism.</p>

<p><b>4. The Desire for Honor, or Social Esteem.</b>&mdash;James,
in his psychology of the self, calls the recognition which
a man gets from his mates his "social self." "We are not
only gregarious animals, liking to be in sight of our fellows,
but we have an innate propensity to get ourselves
noticed, and noticed favorably by our kind. No more fiendish
punishment could be devised, were such a thing physically
possible, than that one should be turned loose in
society and remain absolutely unnoticed by all the members<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
thereof."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> From such a punishment "the cruelest bodily
tortures would be a relief; for this would make us feel that
however bad might be our plight, we had not sunk to such
depth as to be unworthy of attention at all."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Honor or
fame is a name for one of the various "social selves" which
a man may build up. It stands for what those of a given
group may think or say of him. It has a place and a
large place in group life. Precedence, salutations, decorations
in costume and bodily ornament, praises in song
for the brave, the strong, the cunning, the powerful, with
ridicule for the coward or the weakling are all at work.
But with the primitive group the difference between men
of the group is kept within bounds. When more definite
organization of groups for military or civil purposes begins,
when the feudal chief gathers his retainers and
begins to rise above the rest of the community in strength,
finally when the progress of the arts gives greater means
for display, the desire for recognition has immensely
greater scope. It is increased by the instinct of emulation;
it often results in envy and jealousies. It becomes then a
powerful factor in stimulating individualism.</p>

<p>But while desires for honor and fame provoke individualism,
they carry with them, like desires for property and
power, elements that make for reconstruction of the social
on a higher level. For honor implies some common sentiment
to which the individual can make appeal. Group members
praise or blame what accords with their feeling or desire,
but they do not act as individuals merely, praising
what pleases them as individuals. They react more or less
completely from the group point of view; they honor the
man who embodies the group-ideal of courage, or other admirable
and respected qualities. And here comes the
motive which operates to force a better ideal than mere
desire of praise. No group honors the man who is definitely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
seeking merely its applause rather than its approval&mdash;at
least not after it has found him out. The force of public
opinion is therefore calculated to elicit a desire to be
<i>worthy</i> of honor, as well as to be honored. This means a
desire to act as a true social individual, for it is only the
true member of the group,&mdash;true clansman,&mdash;true patriot,&mdash;true
martyr,&mdash;who appeals to the other members when
they judge as members, and not selfishly. When now the
group whose approval is sought is small, we have class
standards, with all the provincialism, narrowness, and
prejudice that belong to them. As the honor-seeker is
merely after the opinion of his class, he is bound to be
only partly social. So long as he is with his kin, or his
set, or his "gang," or his "party," or his "union," or
his "country"&mdash;regardless of any wider appeal&mdash;he is
bound to be imperfectly rational and social in his conduct.
The great possibilities of the desire for honor,
and of the desire to be worthy of honor, lie then in the
constant extension of the range. The martyr, the seeker
for truth, the reformer, the neglected artist, looks for
honor from posterity; if misjudged or neglected, he appeals
to mankind. He is thus forming for himself an
ideal standard. And if he embodies this ideal standard
in a personal, highest possible judging companion, his
desire to be worthy of approval takes a religious form.
He seeks "the honor that is from God." Though "the
innermost of the empirical selves of a man is a self
of the <i>social</i> sort, it yet can find its only adequate <i>socius</i>
in an ideal world."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The moral value of these three forces of individualism
was finely stated by Kant:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The means which nature uses to bring about the development
of all the capacities she has given man is their <i>antagonism</i>
in society, in so far as this antagonism becomes in the end
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>a cause of social order. Men have an inclination to <i>associate</i>
themselves, for in a social state they feel themselves more
completely men: i.e., they are conscious of the development
of their natural capacities. But they have also a great propensity
to <i>isolate</i> themselves, for they find in themselves at the
same time this unsocial characteristic: each wishes to direct
everything solely according to his own notion, and hence
expects resistance, just as he knows that he is inclined to resist
others. It is just this resistance which awakens all man's
powers; this brings him to overcome his propensity to indolence,
and drives him through the lust for honor, power, or
wealth to win for himself a rank among his fellowmen. Man's
will is for concord, but nature knows better what is good for
the species, and she wills discord. He would like a life of
comfort and pleasure; nature wills that he be dragged out of
idleness and inactive content, and plunged into labor and
trouble in order that he may find out the means of extricating
himself from his difficulties. The natural impulses which
prompt this effort, the sources of unsociableness and of the
mutual conflict from which so many evils spring, are then
spurs to a more complete development of man's powers."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p></div>

<p>We have spoken of the "forces" which tend to break
down the old unity of the group and bring about new
organization. But of course these forces are not impersonal.
Sometimes they seem to act like the ocean
tide, pushing silently in, and only now and then sending
a wave a little higher than its fellows. Frequently, however,
some great personality stands out pre&euml;minent, either
as critic of the old or builder of the new. The prophets
were stoned because they condemned the present; the next
generation was ready to build their sepulchers. Socrates
is the classic example of the great man who perishes in
seeking to find a rational basis to replace that of custom.
Indeed, this conflict&mdash;on the one hand, the rigid system of
tradition and corporate union hallowed by all the sanctions
of religion and public opinion; upon the other, the individual
making appeal to reason, or to his conscience, or to
a "higher law"&mdash;is the tragedy of history.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 4. POSITIVE RECONSTRUCTION</h4>

<p>It must not be supposed that the moral process stops
at the points indicated under the several divisions of this
last section. As already stated, if the people really
works out a higher type of conscious and personal morality,
it means not only a more powerful individual, but
a reconstructed individual and a reconstructed society.
It means not only the disintegration of the old kinship or
family group, which is an economic, political, and religious
unity as well. It means the construction of a new
basis for the family; new moral principles for business;
a distinct political state with new means for government,
new conceptions of authority and liberty; finally, a national
or universal religion. And the individual must on
this higher level choose all these voluntarily. More than
this: as he chooses in the presence of the new conflicting
ends presented by individualism, he sets up or adopts a
standard for himself. He thinks definitely of what is
"good" and "right." As he recognizes its claim, he is
responsible as well as free. As he identifies himself heartily
with it, he becomes sincerely and genuinely moral. Reverence,
duty, and love for what is good become the
quickening emotions. Thoughtfulness, self-control, aspiration
toward an ideal, courageous venturing in its achievement,
kindness and justice, become the dominant temper,
or at least are recognized as the temper that should
be dominant. The conception of moral character and
moral personality is brought to consciousness. The development
of the Hebrews and Greeks will show how these
positive values emerge.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER VI</small>

<br /><br />

THE HEBREW MORAL DEVELOPMENT</h2>


<h4>&sect; 1. GENERAL CHARACTER AND DETERMINING PRINCIPLES</h4>

<p><b>1. The Hebrew and the Greek.</b>&mdash;The general character
of the Hebrew moral development may be brought
out by a contrast with that of the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> While many
phases are common, there is yet a difference in emphasis
and focus. There were political and economic forces at
work in Israel, and religious forces in Greece. Nevertheless,
the moral life in one people kept close to the religious,
and in the other found independent channels. Conscientious
conduct for the Hebrew centered in doing the
will of God; for the Greek, in finding rational standards
of good. For the Hebrew, righteousness was the typical
theme; for the Greek, the ideal lay rather in measure
and harmony. For the Greek, wisdom or insight was
the chief virtue; for the Hebrew, the fear of the Lord
was the beginning of wisdom. The social ideal of the
Hebrews was the kingdom of God; of the Greeks, a political
State. If we distinguish in conscience two aspects,
thoughtfulness in discovering what to do and hearty desire
to do the right when found, then the Greeks emphasize
the former, the Hebrews the latter. Intellect plays a
larger part with the Greek; emotion and the voluntary
aspect of will with the Hebrew. Feeling plays its part
with the Greeks largely as an &aelig;sthetic demand for measure
and harmony; with the Hebrews it is chiefly prominent
in motivation, where it is an element in what is called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
"the heart," or it functions in appreciation of acts performed,
as the joy or sorrow felt when God approves or
condemns. Both peoples are interesting for our study,
not only as illustrating different kinds of moral development,
but also as contributing largely to the moral consciousness
of western peoples to-day.</p>

<p><b>2. The Early Morality.</b>&mdash;The accounts of the tribal
life and customs in the early period after the settlement
in Canaan, show the main features of group life which are
already familiar to us. Clan or kinship loyalty was strong
on both its good and its defective sides. There were fidelity,
a jeoparding of lives unto death, honor for group heroes,
joint responsibility, and blood revenge. There were respect
for hospitality and regulation of marriage, though not according
to later standards. A rough measure of justice
was recognized in "as I have done, so God hath requited
me." But there was no public authority to restrain the
wrongdoer, except when a particularly revolting brutality
shocked public sentiment. Festivals and sacrificial meals
united the members of the family or clan more closely
to each other and to their god. Vows must be kept
inviolable even if they involved human sacrifice. The interests
and ends of life were simple. The satisfaction
of bodily wants, the love of kin and above all of children,
the desire to be in right relation of favor and harmony
with the unseen deity who protected from enemies and sent
fruitful seasons,&mdash;these made their chief good. The line
of their progress from these rude beginnings to a lofty
moral ideal lay through religion. But the religious conceptions
were directly related to political, social, and
economic conditions; hence, both aspects must be briefly
characterized.</p>

<p><b>3. Political Development.</b>&mdash;The political development
(a) built up a national unity which worked to break down
old group units, (b) strengthened military ambition and
race pride, (c) stimulated the prophets to their highest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
conceptions of the divine majesty and universality, but,
finally when the national power and hope were shattered,
(d) compelled the most thoroughgoing reconstruction
of all the values, ideals, and meaning of life. It is not
possible or necessary to trace this process in detail, but
we may point out here the general effect of the political
development in bringing into clearer consciousness the
conceptions of authority and law which were important
factors in Hebrew morality. The earlier patriarchal
head of the clan or family exercised certain political
power, but there was no explicit recognition of this. Government
by the "elders" or by the heads of the household
makes no clear distinction between the common kinship
and the political and legal authority of the sovereign.
The "judges," whose rule preceded the kingdom, were
military deliverers who owed their authority to personal
powers rather than to a definite provision. To establish
an organized political community, a kingdom, was then
to bring into clearer recognition this element of authority
which was merely implicit in the tribal organization. It
allowed a more distinctly voluntary relationship to be
differentiated from the involuntary relationship of kinship,
or the personal relationship of the hero. While, therefore,
in the formation of the kingdom the earlier prophets
saw only a rejection of God, the later prophets saw in
it the symbol of a higher type of relation between God and
people. It was given religious sanction and the king was
regarded as the son of Jehovah. It was thus ready to
serve as the scheme or setting for the moral unity and
order of a people.</p>

<p><b>4. The Economic Factors.</b>&mdash;The organization and growing
prosperity of the political power were attended by economic
and social changes. The simple agricultural life
of the early period had not caused entire loss of clan
organization and customs. But the growth of trade and
commerce under Solomon and later kings brought in wealth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and shifted the center of power and influence from country
to city. Wealth and luxury had their usual results.
Clashing interests asserted their strength. Economic and
social individualism destroyed the old group solidarity.
At the times of the prophets Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, there
were classes of rich and poor. Greed had asserted itself
in rulers, judges, priests, and "regular" prophets. Oppression,
land monopoly, bribery, extortion, stirred moral
indignation. The fact that these were practiced by the
most zealous observers of ritual and guardians of religion
roused in the great reformers a demand for a change in
religion itself. Not sacrifices but justice is the need of
the hour and the demand of God.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. RELIGIOUS AGENCIES</h4>

<p>The interaction between the religious and the moral
education of the Hebrews was so intimate that it is difficult
to distinguish the two, but we may abstract certain conceptions
or motives in Israel's religion which were especially
significant. The general conception was that of
the close personal relation between god and people. Israel
should have no other god; Jehovah&mdash;at least this was the
earlier thought&mdash;would have no other people. He had
loved and chosen Israel; Israel in gratitude, as well as
in hope and fear, must love and obey Jehovah. Priests
maintained his cultus; prophets brought new commands
according to the requirements of the hour; the king represented
his sovereignty and justice; the course of events
exhibited his purpose. Each of these elements served to
provoke or elicit moral reflection or moral conduct.</p>

<p><b>1. The "Covenant" Relation was a Moral Conception.</b>&mdash;The
usual religious conception is that of some blood
or kin relation between people and deity. This has the
same potential meaning and value as that of the other
relations of group life outlined in Chapter II. But it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
rather a natural than a "moral"&mdash;i.e., conscious and
voluntary&mdash;tie. To conceive of the relation between god
and people as due to voluntary choice, is to introduce
a powerful agency toward making morality conscious.
Whatever the origin of the idea, the significant fact is
that the religious and moral leaders present the relation
of Israel to Jehovah as based on a covenant. On the
one hand, Jehovah protects, preserves, and prospers; on
the other, Israel is to obey his laws and serve no other
gods. This conception of mutual obligation is presented
at the opening of the "Ten Commandments," and to this
covenant relation the prophets again and again make
appeal. The obligation to obey the law is not "This is
the custom," or "Our fathers did so"; it is placed on the
ground that the people has voluntarily accepted Jehovah
as its god and lawgiver.</p>

<p>The meaning of this covenant and the symbols by which
it was conceived, changed with the advance of the social
relationships of the people. At first Jehovah was "Lord
of Hosts," protector in war, and giver of prosperity,
and the early conceptions of the duty of the people seemed
to include human sacrifice, at least in extreme cases. But
with later prophets we find the social and family relationship
of husband and father brought increasingly into
use. Whether by personal experience or by more general
reflection, we find Hosea interpreting the relationship
between God and his people in both of these family conceptions.
The disloyalty of the people takes on the more
intimate taint of a wife's unfaithfulness, and, conversely,
in contrast to the concepts of other religions, the people
may call Jehovah "my husband" and no longer "my
master" (Baal). The change from status to contract is
thus, in Israel's religion, fruitful with many moral results.</p>

<p><b>2. The Conception of a Personal Lawgiver.</b>&mdash;The conception
of a personal lawgiver raises conduct from the
level of custom to the level of conscious morality.  So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
long as a child follows certain ways by imitation or suggestion,
he does not necessarily attach any moral meaning
to them. But if the parent expressly commands or
prohibits, it becomes a matter of obedience or disobedience.
Choice becomes necessary. Character takes the
place of innocence. So Jehovah's law compelled obedience
or rebellion. Customs were either forbidden or enjoined.
In either case they ceased to be merely customs. In the
law of Israel the whole body of observances in private
life, in ceremonial, and in legal forms, is introduced with
a "Thus saith the Lord." We know that other Semitic
people observed the Sabbath, practiced circumcision, distinguished
clean from unclean beasts, and respected the
taboos of birth and death. Whether in Israel all these observances
were old customs given new authority by statute,
or were customs taken from other peoples under the authority
of the laws of Jehovah, is immaterial. The ethical significance
of the law is that these various observances, instead
of being treated merely as customs, are regarded as
personal commands of a personal deity.</p>

<p>This makes a vital difference in the view taken of the violation
of these observances. When a man violates a custom
he fails to do the correct thing. He misses the mark.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
But when the observance is a personal command, its violation
is a personal disobedience; it is rebellion; it is an act
of will. The evil which follows is no longer bad luck; it
is punishment. Now punishment must be either right
or wrong, moral or immoral. It can never be merely non-moral.
Hence the very conception of sin as a personal
offense, and of ill as a personal punishment, forces a moral
standard. In its crudest form this may take the god's
commands as right simply because he utters them, and
assume that the sufferer is guilty merely because he suffers.
We find this in the penitential psalms of the Babylonians.
These express the deepest conviction of sin and the utmost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
desire to please the god, but when we try to discover
what the penitent has done that wakens such remorse
within him, we find that he seems merely to feel that in
some way he has failed to please God, no matter how. He
experiences misfortune, whether of disease, or ill-luck, or
defeat, and is sure that this must be due to some offense.
He does not know what this may be. It may have been
that he has failed to repeat a formula in the right manner;
it is all one. He feels guilty and even exaggerates
his own guilt in view of the punishment which has befallen
him. Job's three friends apply the same logic to his case.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>But side by side with the conception that the laws of
Jehovah must be obeyed because they were his commands,
there was another doctrine which was but an extension of
the theory that the people had freely accepted their ruler.
This was that Jehovah's commands were not arbitrary.
They were right; they could be placed before the people
for their approval; they were "life"; "the judge of all
the earth" would "do right." We have here a striking
illustration of the principle that moral standards, at first
embodied in persons, slowly work free, so that persons are
judged by them.</p>

<p><b>3. The Cultus as Morally Symbolical.</b>&mdash;The elaborate
cultus carried on by the priests, symbolized, however
imperfectly, certain moral ideas. The solicitous care for
ceremonial "purity" might have no direct moral value;
the contamination from contact with birth or death or
certain animals might be a very external sort of "un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>cleanness."
Nevertheless, they emphasized in the most
forcible manner a constant control over conduct by a
standard which was set by a divine law. The "holiness"
of the priests, as set apart to special service of Jehovah,
emphasized the seriousness of their work; and further,
it contributed to that distinction between spiritual and
material, between higher and lower, which is a part of
moral life. Moreover, while part of this value inheres in
all ritual, the contrast between Jehovah's worship and
that of other deities challenged moral attention. The gods
of the land, the various Baals, were worshipped "upon
every high hill and under every green tree." As gods
of fertility, they were symbolized by the emblems of sex,
and great freedom prevailed at their festivals. At certain
shrines men and women gave themselves for the service
of the god. The first born children were not infrequently
sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> These festivals and shrines seem to have been
adopted more or less fully by Israel from the Canaanites,
but the prophets have an utterly different idea of Jehovah's
worship. The god of Sinai rejects utterly such
practices. License and drunkenness are not, as the cultus
of Baal and Astarte implied, the proper symbols of life
and deity. The sensual cannot fitly symbolize the spiritual.</p>

<p>Moreover, one part of the cultus, the "sin offering,"
directly implied transgression and the need of forgiveness.
The "sins" might themselves be ceremonial rather than
moral, and the method of removing them might be external&mdash;especially
the process of putting the sins upon
a scapegoat which should "bear upon him all their iniquities
into a solitary land,"&mdash;nevertheless, the solemn confession,
and the shedding of the blood which was the
"life," could not but remind of responsibility and deepen
reflection. The need of atonement and reconciliation, thus
impressed, symbolized the moral process of reconstructing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of putting away a lower past, and readjusting life to
meet an ideal.</p>

<p><b>4. The Prophets as a Moral Force.</b>&mdash;The prophets
were by far the most significant moral agency in Israel's
religion. In the first place, they came to the people
bearing a message from a living source of authority, intended
for the immediate situation. They brought a present
command for a present duty. "Thou art the man,"
of Nathan to David, "Hast thou killed, and also taken
possession?" of Elijah to Ahab, had personal occasions.
But the great sermons of Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, were
no less for the hour. A licentious festival, an Assyrian
invasion, an Egyptian embassy, a plague of locusts, an
impending captivity&mdash;these inspire demand for repentance,
warnings of destruction, promises of salvation. The
prophet was thus the "living fountain." The divine will
as coming through him "was still, so to speak, fluid, and
not congealed into institutions."</p>

<p>In the second place, the prophets seized upon the inward
purpose and social conduct of man as the all-important
issues; cultus, sacrifice, are unimportant. "I hate, I despise
your feasts, and I will take no delight in your
solemn assemblies," cries Amos in Jehovah's name, "But
let justice roll down as waters and righteousness as a
mighty stream." "I have had enough of the burnt offerings
of rams, and the fat of fed beasts," proclaims Isaiah,
"new moons, and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies,&mdash;I
cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting." You
need not ceremonial, but moral, purity. "Wash you, make
you clean; put away the evil of your doings;&mdash;seek justice,
relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead
for the widow." Micah's "Shall I give my first-born for
my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my
soul?" seized upon the difference once for all between the
physical and the moral; a completely ethical standpoint
is gained in his summary of religious duty: "What doth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
God require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy God?" And the New Testament
analogue marks the true ethical valuation of all the
external religious manifestations, even of the cruder forms
of prophecy itself. Gifts, mysteries, knowledge, or the
"body to be burned"&mdash;there is a more excellent way than
these. For all these are "in part." Their value is but
temporary and relative. The values that abide, that stand
criticism, are that staking of oneself upon the truth and
worth of one's ideal which is faith; that aspiration and
forward look which is hope; that sum of all social charity,
sympathy, justice, and active helpfulness, which is love.
"But the greatest of these is love."</p>

<p><b>5. The Religious View of the Kingdom Gave the
Setting for a Social Ideal.</b>&mdash;Jehovah was the king of
his people. The human ruler in Jerusalem was his representative.
The kingdom of Israel was under divine care
and had on the other hand a serious purpose. The expansion
and glory of the kingdom under Solomon showed
the divine favor. Division and calamity were not mere
misfortunes, or the victory of greater armies; they were
divine rebukes. Only in righteousness and justice could
the nation survive. On the other hand, the confidence in
Jehovah's love for Israel guaranteed that he would never
forsake his people. He would purify them and redeem
them even from the grave. He would establish a kingdom
of law and peace, "an everlasting kingdom that should
not be destroyed." Politics in Israel had a moral goal.</p>

<p><b>6. Religion Gave the Problem of Evil a Moral Significance.</b>&mdash;The
Greek treatment of the problem of evil
is found in the great tragedies. An ancestral curse follows
down successive generations, dealing woe to all the
unhappy house. For the victims there seems to be nothing
but to suffer. The necessity of destiny makes the
catastrophe sublime, but also hopeless. Ibsen's <i>Ghosts</i>
is conceived in a similar spirit. There is a tremendous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
moral lesson in it for the fathers, but for the children
only horror. The Greek and the Scandinavian are doubtless
interpreting one phase of human life&mdash;its continuity
and dependence upon cosmical nature. But the Hebrew
was not content with this. His confidence in a divine government
of the world forced him to seek some moral value,
some purpose in the event. The search led along one path
to a readjustment of values; it led by another path to a
new view of social interdependence.</p>

<p>The book of Job gives the deepest study of the first
of these problems. The old view had been that virtue
and happiness always went together. Prosperity meant
divine favor, and therefore it must be the good. Adversity
meant divine punishment; it showed wrongdoing
and was itself an evil. When calamity comes upon Job, his
friends assume it to be a sure proof of his wickedness.
He had himself held the same view, and since he refuses
to admit his wickedness and "holds fast to his integrity,"
it confounds all his philosophy of life and of God. It
compels a "reversal and revaluation of all values." If
he could only meet God face to face and have it out
with him he believes there would be some solution. But
come what may, he will not sell his soul for happiness.
To "repent," as his friends urge, in order that he may
be again on good terms with God, would mean for him to
call sin what he believes to be righteousness. And he will
not lie in this way. God is doubtless stronger, and if
he pursues his victim relentlessly, may convict him. But
be this as it may, Job will not let go his fundamental
consciousness of right and wrong. His "moral self"
is the one anchor that holds, is the supreme value of life.</p>

<p class="poem">
"As God liveth, who hath taken away my right,<br />
And the Almighty who hath vexed my soul;<br />
Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness.<br />
Till I die, I will not put away my integrity from me,<br />
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p class="noidt">Another suggestion of the book is that evil comes to
prove man's sincerity: "Does Job serve God for naught?"
and from that standpoint the answer is, Yes; he does.
"There is a disinterested love of God."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In this setting,
also, the experience of suffering produces a shifting of
values from the extrinsic to the internal.</p>

<p>The other treatment of the problem of suffering is
found in the latter half of Isaiah. It finds an interpretation
of the problem by a deeper view of social interdependence,
in which the old tribal solidarity is given, as it
were, a transfigured meaning. The individualistic interpretation
of suffering was that it meant personal guilt.
"We did esteem him stricken of God." This breaks down.
The suffering servant is not wicked. He is suffering for
others&mdash;in some sense. "He hath borne our griefs and
carried our sorrows." The conception here reached of
an interrelation which involves that the suffering of the
good may be due to the sin or the suffering of others,
and that the assumption of this burden marks the higher
type of ethical relation, is one of the finest products of
Israel's religion. As made central in the Christian conception
of the Cross, it has furnished one of the great elements
in the modern social consciousness.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. THE MORAL CONCEPTIONS ATTAINED</h4>

<p>The moral conceptions which were thus worked out may
now be brought together for convenient summary under
the two heads of the "How" and the "What" indicated
in our introductory chapter. Under the first we
specify the conceptions resulting (1) from recognition of
a standard of right, and an ideal of good, (2) from
free choice of this ideal. Under the What we indicate
the content of the ideal on both its personal and its social
sides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p><b>1. Righteousness and Sin.</b>&mdash;Righteousness and sin
were not exact or contradictory opposites. The righteous
man was not necessarily sinless. Nevertheless, the consciousness
of sin, like a dark background, brought out
more emphatically the conception of righteousness. This
conception had its two aspects, derived from the civil and
the religious spheres of life&mdash;spheres which were not
separate for the Hebrew. On the one hand, the just or
righteous respected the moral order in human society.
The unrighteous was unjust, extortionate, cruel. He did
not respect the rights of others. On the other hand,
the righteous man was in "right" relation to God. This
right relation might be tested by the divine law; but as
God was conceived as a living person, loving his people,
"forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin," it might
also be measured by an essential harmony of spirit with
the divine will. There was the "righteousness of the law,"
and the "righteousness of faith." The first implies complete
obedience; the second implies that in spite of transgressions
there is room for atonement<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> or reconciliation.
As the first means ethically the testing of conduct by a
moral standard, a "moral law," so the second stands for
the thought that character is rather a matter of spirit
and of constant reconstruction than of exact conformity
once for all to a hard and fast rule. Specific acts may
fail to conform, but the life is more than a series of specific
acts. The measurement of conduct by the law has its
value to quicken a sense of shortcoming, but alone it may
also lead either to self-righteous complacency or to despair.
The possibility of new adjustment, of renewal, of
"a new birth," means liberation and life. As such it may
be contrasted with the Buddhist doctrine of Karma, the
causality from which there is no escape but by the extinction
of desire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sin" had likewise its various aspects. It stood for
missing the mark, for violating the rules of clean and unclean;
but it stood also for personal disobedience to the
divine will, for violation of the moral order of Israel. In
this latter sense, as identified by the prophets with social
unrighteousness, it is a significant ethical conception. It
brings out the point that evil and wrongdoing are not
merely individual matters, not merely failures; they offend
against a law which is above the private self, against a
moral order which has its rightful demands upon us.</p>

<p><b>2. Personal Responsibility.</b>&mdash;The transition from group
to individual responsibility was thoroughly worked out by
the prophets, even if they were not able to carry full popular
assent. In early days the whole kin was treated as guilty
for the offense of the kinsman. Achan's case has already
been cited; and in the case of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
"Their wives and their sons and their little ones" were
all treated alike.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In like manner, the family of the
righteous man shared in the divine favor. The later
prophets pronounced a radical change. The proverb,
"The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's
teeth are set on edge," is no more to be used, declares
Ezekiel, speaking for Jehovah. "The soul that sinneth, it
shall die; the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father,
neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son;"
and it is especially interesting to note that the Lord is
represented as pleading with the people that this is fair,
while the people say, "Wherefore doth not the son bear
the iniquity of the father?" The solidarity of the family
resisted the individualism of the prophetic conception, and
five hundred years after Ezekiel the traces of the older
conception still lingered in the question, "Who did sin,
this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> For
another aspect of responsibility, viz., intent, as distinct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
from accidental action,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> we have certain transitional steps
shown in the interesting "cities of refuge"<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> for the accidental
homicide in which he might be safe from the
avenger of blood, provided he was swift enough of foot to
reach a city of refuge before he was caught. But the fullest
development in the ethics of responsibility along this
line seemed to take the form described under the next head.</p>

<p><b>3. Sincerity, and Purity of Motive.</b>&mdash;The Hebrew had
a philosophy of conduct which made it chiefly a matter
of "wisdom" and "folly," but the favorite term of prophet
and psalmist to symbolize the central principle was rather
"the heart." This term stood for the voluntary disposition,
especially in its inner springs of emotions and sentiments,
affections and passions. The Greek was inclined
to look askance at this side of life, to regard the emotions
as perturbations of the soul, and to seek their control
by reason, or even their repression or elimination. The
Hebrew found a more positive value in the emotional side
of conduct, and at the same time worked out the conception
of a sincere and thoroughgoing interest as lying
at the very root of all right life. The religious influence
was as elsewhere the important agency. "Man
looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh
on the heart," "If I regard iniquity in my heart, Jehovah
will not hear me," are characteristic expressions. A divine
vision, which penetrates to the deepest springs of purpose
and feeling, will not tolerate pretense. Nor will it be satisfied
with anything less than entire devotion: the Israelite
must serve Jehovah with all his heart.  Outer con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>formity
is not enough: "Rend your heart and not your
garments." It is the "pure in heart" who have the
beatific vision. Not external contacts, or ceremonial
"uncleanness," on which earlier ritual had insisted, defile
the man, but rather what proceeds from the heart. For
the heart is the source of evil thoughts and evil deeds.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
And conversely, the interests, the emotions, and enthusiasms
which make up the man's deepest self do not spring
forth in a vacuum; they go with the steadfast purpose
and bent, with the self of achievement. "Where your
treasure is, there will your heart be also."</p>

<p>Purity of motive in a full moral consciousness means
not only (formal) sincerity, but sincere love of good
and right. This was not stated by the Hebrew in abstract
terms, but in the personal language of love to God. In
early days there had been more or less of external motives
in the appeals of the law and the prophets. Fear
of punishment, hope of reward, blessings in basket and
store, curses in land and field, were used to induce fidelity.
But some of the prophets sought a deeper view, which
seems to have been reached in the bitterness of human
experience. Hosea's wife had forsaken him, and should not
the love of people to Jehovah be as personal and sincere
as that of wife to husband? She had said, "I will go
after my lovers <i>that give me my bread and my water, my
wood and my flax, my oil and my drink</i>."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Is not serving
God for hire a form of prostitution?<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The calamities
of the nation tested the disinterestedness of its fidelity.
They were the challenge of the Adversary, "Doth Job
fear God for naught?" And a remnant at least attested
that fidelity did not depend on rewards. The moral maxim
that virtue is its own reward is put in personal terms
by the prophet after the exile:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For though the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall

<p><b>4. The Conception of "Life" as an Ideal.</b>&mdash;The content
of Israel's moral ideal on its individual side was
expressed by the term "Life." All the blessings that the
leader of Israel could offer his people were summarized
in the phrase, "I have set before you life and death;
wherefore choose life." The same final standard of value
appears in the question of Jesus, "What shall it profit
a man to gain the whole world and lose his own life?"
When we inquire what life meant, so far as the early
sources give us data for judgment, we must infer it
to have been measured largely in terms of material comfort
and prosperity, accompanied by the satisfaction of
standing in right relations to the god and ruler. This
latter element was so closely united with the first that
it was practically identical with it. If the people were
prosperous they might assume that they were right; if
they suffered they were surely wrong. Good and evil
were, therefore, in this stage, measured largely in terms
of pleasure and pain. The end to be sought and the ideal
to be kept in mind was that of long and prosperous life&mdash;"in
her right hand length of days, in her left hand
riches and honor." Intellectual and &aelig;sthetic interests
were not prized as such. The knowledge which was
valued was the wisdom for the conduct of life, of which
the beginning and crown was "the fear of the Lord."
The art which was valued was sacred song or poetry.
But the ideal values which came to bulk most in the expanding
conception of "life" were those of personal relation.
Family ties, always strong among Oriental peoples,
gained in purity. Love between the sexes was refined and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
idealized.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> National feeling took on added dignity, because
of the consciousness of a divine mission. Above all,
personal union with God, as voiced in the psalms and
prophets, became the desire. He, and not his gifts, was
the supreme good. He was the "fountain of life." His
likeness would satisfy. In his light the faithful would
see light.</p>

<p>But even more significant than any specific content put
into the term "life," was <i>what was involved in the idea
itself</i>. The legalists had attempted to define conduct
by a code, but there was an inherent vitality in the ideal
of life, which refused to be measured or bounded. The
"words of eternal life," which began the new moral movement
of Christianity, had perhaps little definite content
to the fishermen, and it is not easy to say just what they
meant in moral terms to the writer of the Fourth Gospel
who uses the phrase so often. With Paul, life as the realm
of the spirit gets definition as it stands over against
the "death" of sin and lust. But with all writers of Old
or New Testament, whatever content it had, life meant
above all the suggestion of something beyond, the gleam
and dynamic power of a future not yet understood. It
meant to Paul a progress which was governed not by
law or "rudiments," but by freedom. Such a life would
set itself new and higher standards; the laws and customs
that had obtained were felt to be outgrown. The significance
of early Christianity as a moral movement, aside
from its elements of personal devotion and social unity to
be noticed below, was the spirit of movement, the sense of
newly forming horizons beyond the old, the conviction
that as sons of God its followers had boundless possibilities,
that they were not the children of the bond woman,
but of the free.</p>

<p><b>5. The Social Ideal of Justice, Love, and Peace.</b>&mdash;We
have seen how this ideal was framed in the setting of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
a kingdom of God. At first national, it became universal,
and with a fraternity which the world is far from having
realized, it was to know "neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor
free." At first military, it took on with seer and psalmist
the form of a reign of peace and justice. After the fierce
and crude powers typified by the lion and the bear and
the leopard had passed, the seer saw a kingdom represented
by a human form. Such a kingdom it was that
should not pass away. Such was the kingdom "not of this
world" which Jesus presented as his message. Membership
in this moral kingdom was for the poor in spirit,
the pure in heart, the merciful, the peace-makers, the
hungerers after righteousness. Greatness in this moral
community was to depend on service, not on power. The
king should not fail till he had "set justice in the earth."
He should "deliver the needy, and the poor."</p>

<p>Certain features of this ideal order have since found
embodiment in social and political structures; certain
features remain for the future. Certain periods in history
have transferred the ideal entirely to another world, regarding
human society as hopelessly given over to evil.
Such theories find a morality possible only by renouncing
society. The Hebrews presented rather the ideal of a
moral order on earth, of a control of all life by right, of
a realization of good, and of a completeness of life. It
was an ideal not dreamed out in ecstatic visions of pure
fancy, but worked out in struggle and suffering, in confidence
that moral efforts are not hopeless or destined to
defeat. The ideal order is to be made real. The divine
kingdom is to come, the divine will to be done "<i>on earth</i>
as it is in heaven."</p>

<br /><br />

THE MORAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREEKS</h2>


<h4>&sect; 1. THE FUNDAMENTAL NOTES</h4>

<p><b>Convention versus Nature.</b>&mdash;The Hebrew moral life
was developed under the relation, first of the people, then
of the individuals, to God,&mdash;a relation at once of union
and of conflict. It was out of the relation of the individual
to social traditions and political order that the
Greek came to full consciousness of moral law on the
one hand, and a moral personality on the other. And
just as in Jewish life the law and the prophets (or,
later, the "law and the gospel") stood for the conflicting
forces, so in Greek life the opposition between the authority
of the group, embodied in custom and institutions, on
the one hand, and the urging claims of developing personality,
manifest in both intelligence and desire, on the
other, found expression in contrasted terms. The authority
of the group embodied in customs and institutions, came
to be regarded by the radicals as relatively external, artificial,
and rigid. It was dubbed "convention," or "institution"
(<i>thesis</i>, what is set up). The rapidly developing
intelligence challenged the merely customary and traditional;
the increasing individuality challenged the superior
authority of the group, especially when this manifested
itself apparently in a government of force. Personal
intelligence and personal feeling asserted a more elemental
claim, felt themselves rooted in a more original source,
and called this source "nature" (<i>physis</i>). Social tradition
and authority, individual reason and feeling, thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>confronted each other as "convention" and "nature." It
was a struggle which has its analogy in the development of
many a young man or young woman who is emerging from
parental control to self-direction. But in Greek life more
distinctly than elsewhere we see the steps of the process
as a civic and not merely an individual development.
&AElig;schylus, Sophocles, and Euripides presented this conflict
of the individual with law or destiny as the great,
oft-repeated tragedy of human life. Aristophanes mocked
with bitter satire the "new" views. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,
Cynics, Cyrenaics, Epicureans, and Stoics took part
in the theoretical discussions.</p>

<p><b>Measure.</b>&mdash;The fundamental note of all Greek life,
before, during, and after this development, was <i>Measure</i>,
<i>Order</i>, <i>Proportion</i>. This note found expression in religion,
science, art, and conduct. Among their gods, the
Greeks set Moira, "Destiny," and Themis, "Custom,"
"Law," "Right." They found order in the universe,
which on this account they called the "cosmos." They
expressed it in their arts, especially in architecture, sculpture,
the choral dance, and the more highly developed
tragedy or lyric:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And all life is full of them [of form and measure]," says
Plato, "as well as every constructive and creative art. And
surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive
art are full of them,&mdash;weaving, embroidery, architecture,
and every kind of manufacture; also nature, animal and
vegetable,&mdash;in all of them there is grace or the absence of
grace; and if our youth are to do their work in life, must they
not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim?"</p></div>

<p>The best people, the "gentlemen," were styled kaloika-gathoi&mdash;"fair
and good." The motto at the Delphic
shrine was, "Nothing in excess." Insolent disregard of
propriety, "hybris," was the quality most denounced by the
early moralizing poets. Tityus, Tantalus, and Sisyphus,
the three special subjects of divine punishment, suffered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
penalty of insatiate desire, or limits overstepped. And
after criticism and individualism had done their work,
Plato's conception of justice, Aristotle's doctrine of the
"mean," the Stoic maxim of "life according to nature,"
have but discovered a deeper significance for the fundamental
law of Greek life.</p>

<p><b>The Good and the Just.</b>&mdash;The conceptions of the Good
and the Just are developed from the two notes just presented.
The motive for challenge to established institutions
was the awakening desire of the individual to seek
his own good and to live his own life. Commerce was
bringing a great variety of rewards to the shrewd merchant
and a great variety of goods to evoke and gratify
wants. Slavery set free the citizen from the need of
manual labor and gave him leisure to cultivate his tastes.
The forces of individualism, described in Chapter V., were
all at work to bring the process and object of desire to
consciousness. Moreover, the term "good" was also in use
to mark the popular ideal. It was applied to what we
should call the "successful" men of the day. In present
life our term "good" has become so definitely moral that
probably most young persons would hesitate to say that
they have it as their ideal to become good, although few
would hesitate to say that they wish to be capable and
successful. For social and political recognition seems to
be based rather on achievement of striking results than
upon what is technically called "goodness." But in Greece
moral goodness was not used to designate "character" as
contrasted with "results." The "good man" was like the
"good lawyer" or "good athlete" or "good soldier," the
man who was efficient and conspicuous. It was in the process
which we are to trace that the ambiguities and deeper
meanings of the term came to definition.</p>

<p>The terms Just and Justice were not of course merely
synonyms for order and measure. They had likewise
the social significance coming from the courts and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
assembly. They stood for the control side of life, as Good
stood for its aspect of valuation and desire. But as compared
with the Hebrew conception of righteousness, they
meant much less a conformity to a law divine or human
which had been already set up as standard, and much
more, an ordering, a regulating, a harmonizing. The
rational element of measure or order was more prominent
than the personal note of authority. Hence we shall find
Plato passing easily back and forth between justice or
order in the individual and justice or order in the State.
On the other hand, the radicals of the day could seize
upon the legal usage and declare that Justice or the Law
was purely a matter of self-interest or class interest.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. INTELLECTUAL FORCES OF INDIVIDUALISM</h4>

<p><b>The Scientific Spirit.</b>&mdash;The older standards were embodied
in religious and political ideas and institutions;
the agency which was to disentangle and bring into clear
consciousness the standards <i>as such</i>, was the scientific
spirit, the knowledge and reflection of an intellectual people
at a period of extraordinarily rapid development. The
commercial life, the free intercourse with other peoples
and civilizations, especially in the colonies, the absence
of any generally dominating political authority, the architectural
problems suggested by a beauty-loving people,&mdash;all
promoted alertness and flexibility of mind.</p>

<p>In a concrete form, this rational character had already
found expression in the quality of Greek art. Reference
has already been made to the formal side of Greek art,
with its embodiment of rhythm and measure; the subject-matter
shows the same element. The Greek world, as contrasted
with the barbarian world, was conceived by the
Greek as the realm of light contrasted with darkness; the
national God, Apollo, embodied this ideal of light and
reason, and his fitting symbol was the sun.  The great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Pan-Athenaic procession, as reproduced in the Parthenon
frieze, celebrated the triumph of Greek light and intelligence
over barbarian darkness. Athena, goddess of wisdom,
was a fitting guardian of the most Greek of all
Greek cities. Greek tragedy, beginning in hymns of
worship, soon passed over into a portrayal of the all-controlling
laws of life, as these are brought into stronger
relief by a tragic collision with human agents.</p>

<p>It was, however, in the realm of science that this intellectual
genius found field for expression in a clearly conscious
manner. Almost all our sciences were originated
by the Greeks, and they were particularly successful in
those which called for abstract thinking in the highest
degree. Euclid's geometry and Aristotle's logic are conspicuous
illustrations of this ability. The most general
conceptions of natural science: e.g., the conception of the
atom and the whole materialistic theory of the universe;
the conception of evolution, meaning by this the process
of change according to an all-controlling law; the conception
of natural selection, according to which those organisms
survive which are fitted for their environment,&mdash;all
these were the product of the keen intelligence of the
Greeks. Nor was their scientific ability expended upon
external nature alone. The conception of history as more
than a series of events, the comparative method in the
study of political systems, the analysis of literary and
artistic effects, attest the same clarity of mind and the
same eager search for the most general laws of every aspect
of experience.</p>

<p><b>Science and Religion.</b>&mdash;When, now, this scientific mind
began to consider the practical guidance of life, the older
political and religious controls presented serious difficulty.
The gods were supposed to reward the good and punish
the evil,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> but how could this be reconciled with their practices?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
&AElig;schylus attempted a purifying and elevating of
the divine ideal, similar to that which Israel's conception
underwent in the work of the prophets. He magnified the
dignity and providential government of Zeus, which,
though dark, is yet just and certain. But the great
obstacle was that the earlier and cruder conceptions of
the gods had been fixed in literary form; the tales of
Cronos's impiety to Uranos, of Zeus' deceitful messenger
and marital unfaithfulness, of Aphrodite's amours, and
Hermes' gift of theft, were all written in Hesiod and
Homer. The cruder conceptions of the gods had thus become
too firmly fixed in the popular imagination to be
capable of becoming the bearers of advancing ethical
ideals, and so not merely the irreverent scoffer, but the
serious tragedian, Euripides, and the religious idealist,
Plato, do not hesitate to challenge boldly the older conceptions,
or to demand a revision of all this literature before
it comes into the hands of the young.</p>

<p><b>Social Standards.</b>&mdash;The social standards of propriety
and honorable conduct were likewise brought in question
by advancing intelligence. The word which summed up
the early Greek idea of the best type was <i>Kalokagathos</i>.
This word was very nearly the equivalent of our English
word "gentleman." It combined the elements of birth,
ability, and refinement, but in the earlier usage the emphasis
was upon the fact of birth, even as our terms "generous,"
"noble," "gentle," originally referred to membership
in a "gens." Socrates investigated the current estimates
and found that the people who were generally regarded
as the "respectable," or, as we should say, the "best"
people of Athens, were not necessarily either "fine" or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
"good" in person or character; the term had come to be
one of "convention," without basis in reason. Plato goes
still further and with a direct application of the rational
standard to the current estimates, pokes fun at the conventional
judgment of what constitutes the respectable
gentleman.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When they sing the praises of family and say that some
one is a gentleman because he has had seven generations of
wealthy ancestors, he [the philosopher] thinks that their sentiments
only betray the dullness and narrowness of vision of
those who utter them, and who are not educated enough to
look at the whole, nor to consider that every man has had
thousands and thousands of progenitors, and among them have
been rich and poor, kings and slaves, Hellenes and barbarians,
many times over. And when some one boasts of a catalogue
of twenty-five ancestors, and goes back to Heracles, the son
of Amphitryon, he cannot understand his poverty of ideas.
Why is he unable to calculate that Amphitryon had a twenty-fifth
ancestor, who might have been anybody, and was such as
fortune made him, and he had a fiftieth, and so on? He is
amused at the notion that he cannot do a sum, and thinks that
a little arithmetic would have got rid of his senseless vanity."</p></div>

<p>The type of life that is really noble or fine and good
is to be found in the seeker for true beauty and goodness.
External beauty of form and appearance has its
value in kindling the desire for the higher forms of beauty,&mdash;beauty
of mind, of institutions and laws, of science,&mdash;until
finally the conception of the true beauty is reached.
This true beauty, as distinct from the particular beauties,
and true good, as distinct from seeming or partial good,
are discovered only by the "philosopher," the seeker for
wisdom.</p>

<p><b>Popular Morals.</b>&mdash;Nor did the more positively recognized
types of moral excellence fare better. As recognized
in common life, they were courage, prudence or moderation,
holiness or a certain respect for the serious things
of life, and justice: but none of these, Plato argues, is
really an independent excellence, apart from conscious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and intelligent action. Courage, for example, is not really
courage unless one knows and foresees the danger in all
its strength; otherwise there is merely reckless bravery.
Prudence or moderation, to be really excellent, must be
measured by wisdom. Even justice cannot be regarded
as at bottom distinct from wisdom, the true measure of
all the relations of life.</p>

<p><b>Science and the Laws.</b>&mdash;The political control was likewise
involved in question by the same forces of intelligence
which had challenged the religious authority. The frequent
changes of government, and the more or less
arbitrary measures that were oftentimes adopted, were
adapted to awaken doubt as to the absolute right and
authority of the laws. The despot who gained control
in many a Greek city was not bound by ties of blood
to all members of the community, nor did he govern in
accordance with the ancestral traditions of the tribe.
The political authority frequently clashed with the instincts
and traditions of family and kinship. Under such
circumstances, the political authority was likely to be
challenged and its constraining power stretched to the
breaking point. So in the <i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles, the
command of the ruler is opposed to the "higher law" of
kinship and nature. The law of man is not the law of
nature or of God. To disobey this conventional law of
man is to be guilty of "holiest crime." The old standards,
both of religion and of political life, crumbled before the
analysis of the developing intelligence, and the demand
for some standard could be met only by the intelligence
itself. To question the old must inevitably seem irreverent
and anarchical. Some questioned merely to doubt; others,
and of these Socrates was the leader, questioned in order
to find a firmer basis, a more authoritative standard. But
naturally the popular mind did not distinguish between
these two classes of questioners, and so Socrates perished,
not merely as the victim of unjust popular calumny, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
as the victim of the tragedy of moral progress, of the
change from the established to the new.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL INDIVIDUALISM</h4>

<p>A further line of development joined forces with this
growth of intelligence, to emphasize the problem of moral
control, and to set the individual with his standards over
against the objective standards of society. This was the
rapidly growing consciousness of individual goods and
interests. The commercial life, with its possibilities of
individual property, the rapid changes of political life,
with the rise of individuals to power and privilege, the
increasing opportunities which a high civilization brought
both men and women for personal enjoyment and gratification
of rapidly increasing wants, all tended to make the
individual seek his own good, and to shift the emphasis
of life from the question, What is proper, or honorable?
to the question, What is <i>good</i>&mdash;good for <i>me</i>?</p>

<p><b>Class Interests.</b>&mdash;The conviction that the authority of
government and law was largely dictated by the very considerations
of private interests which they were supposed
to overrule and eliminate, made the situation more acute.
For the Greek States were no longer groups with common
interests. The growth of capital, the corresponding eagerness
for gain, the formation of distinct classes, each intent
on its interests, supplanted the older, more homogeneous
State. "The whole development of the political
life of the Hellenic republics depended ultimately on the
decision of the question, which of the different social
classes&mdash;the capitalistic minority, the middle class, or
the poor&mdash;should obtain the dominant place." Aristotle
defines an oligarchy as a State governed in the interest
of the rich; a democracy, as a State governed in the
interest of the poor. Another contemporary writer explains
a democracy as consulting the interests of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
democrats, the "lower classes," and considers this a matter
of course, "for if the rich had the say, they would do
what was good for themselves but not for the multitude."
Naturally such dominance by classes called out vigorous
criticisms upon the laws and standards so established.
The aristocratic minority inveighed against "custom" or
conventions which would tame the strong to the level of the
weak. Nature demands rather the "survival of the fittest,"
i.e., of the strong. The enlightened spectator of the game
of government, on the other hand, declares that all laws
are made in the interest of ruling classes. The reader of
current criticisms on laws and courts will see how close
is the parallel to present complaints. We have to-day
the same two classes: One inveighs against governmental
interference with the right to combine, to contract, and
in general to get from the earth or from men, women,
and children all that superior power and shrewdness can
possibly extract. The other complains that legislatures
are owned by wealth, that judges are appointed from corporation
lawyers, that common law is a survival of ancient
aristocratic status, and that for these reasons labor can
get no justice.</p>

<p>Let us first hear the plea for inequality:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Custom and nature are generally at variance with one another;
... for by the rule of nature, that only is the more
disgraceful which is the greater evil; as, for example, to suffer
injustice; but by the rule of custom, to do evil is the more
disgraceful. For this suffering of injustice is not the part of
a man, but of a slave, who indeed had better die than live; for
when he is wronged and trampled upon, he is unable to help
himself or any other about whom he cares. The reason, as I
conceive, is that the makers of laws are the many weak; and
they make laws and distribute praises and censures with a
view to themselves and their own interests; and they terrify
the mightier sort of men, and those who are able to get the
better of them, in order that they may not get the better of
them; and they say that dishonesty is shameful and unjust;
meanwhile, when they speak of injustice, they desire to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
more than their neighbors, for knowing their own inferiority,
they are only too glad of equality. And therefore, this seeking
to have more than the many is conventionally said to be
shameful and unjust, and is called injustice, whereas nature
herself intimates that it is just for the better to have more
than the worse, the more powerful than the weaker; and in
many ways she shows, among men as well as among animals,
and indeed among whole cities and races, that justice consists
in the superior ruling over and having more than the inferior.
For on what principle of justice did Xerxes invade Hellas, or
his father the Scythians? (not to speak of numberless other
examples). They, I conceive, act according to nature; yes,
and according to the law of nature; not perhaps, according to
that artificial law which we frame and fashion, taking the best
and strongest of us from their youth upwards, and taming
them like young lions, and charming them with the sound of
the voice, saying to them that with equality they must be content,
and that this is the honorable and the just. But if there
were a man who had sufficient force, he would shake off and
break through and escape from all this; he would trample
under foot all our formulas and spells and charms, and all our
laws, sinning against nature; the slave would rise in rebellion
and be lord over us, and the light of natural justice would
shine forth. And this I take to be the lesson of Pindar, in
the poem in which he says that</p>

<p class="poem">
"'Law is the King of all, mortals as well as immortals!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">This, as he says:</p>

<p class="poem">
"'Makes might to be right, and does violence with exalted hand; as<br />
I infer from the deeds of Heracles, for without buying them&mdash;&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p>"I do not remember the exact words, but the meaning is,
that he carried off the oxen of Geryon without buying them,
and without their being given to him by Geryon, according
to the law of natural right, and that the oxen and other possessions
of the weaker and inferior properly belong to the
stronger and superior." (<span class="smcap">Plato</span>, <i>Gorgias</i>, 482-4.)</p></div>

<p>The essence of this view is, therefore, that might is
right, and that no legislation or conventional code ought
to stand in the way of the free assertion of genius and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
power. It is similar to the teaching of Nietzsche in
recent times.</p>

<p>But the other side had its complaint also. The laws
are made by the "shepherds" of the people, as Homer
called them. But who is now so simple as to suppose that
the "shepherds" fatten or tend the sheep with a view to
the good of the sheep, and not to their own good? All
laws and governments really exist for the interest of the
ruling class.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> They rest upon convention or "institution,"
not upon "nature."</p>

<p><b>Why Obey Laws?</b>&mdash;And if laws and social codes are but
class legislation, conventional, why obey them? The older
Greek life had felt the motives described in Chapter IV.,
though it had embodied them in symbolism and imagery.
The Nemesis that followed the guilty, the Erinnys, or
avenging goddesses, were the personified wrath of outraged
law; <i>aid&#333;s</i>, respect or reverence, <i>aischyne</i>, regard for public
opinion, were the inner feelings. But with the advancing
tide of intellectual criticism and individual interest, these
sanctions were discredited; feelings of personal enjoyment
demanded recognition, and the moralists at first appealed
to this. "Parents and tutors are always telling their sons
and their wards that they are to be just; but only not for
the sake of justice, but for the sake of character and
reputation." But if the only reason for justice is reputation,
there might seem to be no sufficient reason for
taking the thorny path, if there be an easier. Will not
the youth say, in the words of Pindar:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Can I by justice, or by crooked ways of deceit, ascend a
loftier tower which may be a fortress to me all my days?"<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p></div>

<p>And if I decide that the crooked way is the easier, why
shall I not follow it? My party, or my "union", or my
lawyer will stand by and see me through:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But I hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of
wickedness is often difficult; to which I answer, Nothing great
is easy. Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we
would be happy, to be the path along which we should proceed.
With a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods
and political clubs. And there are professors of
rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies;
and so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall
make unlawful gains and not be punished. Still I hear a
voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived, neither can they
be compelled. But what if there are no gods? or, suppose
them to have no care of human things, why in either case
should we mind about concealment?"<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p></div>

<p>Besides, the greatest prizes, not only in material goods,
but even in the line of reputation, seemed to fall to the
individualist if he could only act on a sufficiently large
scale. He could then be both prosperous and "respectable."
If he could steal the government, or, in modern
phrase, bribe a legislature to elect him to Congress, pass
special legislation, or grant a franchise, he could not
merely escape punishment, but be honored by his fellows.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am speaking of injustice on a large scale, in which the
advantage of the unjust is most apparent, and my meaning
will be most clearly seen in that highest form of injustice, the
perpetrator of which is the happiest of men, as the sufferers
of these who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable&mdash;I
mean tyranny which by fraud and force takes away the property
of others, not retail but wholesale; comprehending in one
things sacred as well as profane, private and public, for any
one of which acts of wrong, if he were detected perpetrating
them singly, he would be punished and incur great dishonor;
for they who are guilty of any of these crimes in single
instances are called robbers of temples and man-stealers and
burglars and swindlers and thieves. But when a man has
taken away the money of the citizens and made slaves of them,
then instead of these dishonorable names, he is called happy
and blessed, not only by the citizens but by all who hear of his
having achieved the consummation of injustice.  For injustice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>is censured because the censurers are afraid of suffering, and
not from any fear which they have of doing injustice. And
thus, as I have shown, Socrates, injustice, when on a sufficient
scale, has more strength and freedom and mastery than justice;
and, as I said at first, justice is the interest of the
stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own profit and interest."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p></div>


<h4>&sect; 4. INDIVIDUALISM AND ETHICAL THEORY</h4>

<p><b>The Question Formulated.</b>&mdash;The outcome of this first
movement was thus twofold: (a) It forced the questions,
"What is just?" "What is good?" into clear and
definite consciousness. The very necessity of comparison
and of getting a <i>general standard</i>, forced the inquirer
to disentangle the concepts previously embodied in customs
and laws. But when the essence was thus found and
freed, or disembodied, as it were, the custom seemed lifeless,
merely "convention", and the essence often quite opposed
to the form. (b) It emphasized the <i>personal interest</i>, the
affective or emotional side of conduct, and made the moral
problem take the form, "What is the good?"</p>

<p>Furthermore, two positive theses have been established
by the very forces which have been active in disintegrating
the old status. If custom no longer suffices, then reason
must set the standard; if society cannot prescribe the good
to the individual, then the individual must find some method
of defining and seeking it for himself unless he is to make
shipwreck of his whole venture.</p>

<p>We may bring both aspects of the problem under the
conception of "nature", as opposed to convention or institution.
Convention is indeed outgrown, nature is the imperious
authority. But granting that nature is rightful
master, is "nature" to be sought in the primitive beginnings,
or in the fullest development? in a life of isolation,
or in a life of society? in the desires and passions, or in
reason and a harmonious life?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Or, stating the same problem otherwise: granting that
reason must fix the measure, and the individual must define
and seek the good for himself, is the good to be found in
isolation, or is it to be sought in human society with its
bonds of family, friendship, and justice? Is the end to
be pleasure, found in the gratification of desires, irrespective
of their quality, and is it the business of reason
merely to measure one gratification with another and get
the most? or is wisdom itself a good, and is it better to
satisfy certain impulses rather than others? i.e., shall
reason form the standard as well as apply it?</p>

<p>These contrasting solutions of the problem of life may
be stated then under the two pairs of antitheses: (1) The
Individual <i>versus</i> the Social; (2) The Immediate Satisfaction
<i>versus</i> an Ideal Standard, at once higher and more
permanent.</p>

<p><b>Typical Solutions.</b>&mdash;Poets, radicals, sensualists, individualists
of no philosophic school, as well as the historic
philosophic schools, contributed to the discussion and solution
of these problems. All sought the "natural" life; but
it is noteworthy that all the philosophic schools claimed
Socrates as their master, and all sought to justify their
answers by reason, all made the wise man the ideal. The
Cynics and Cyrenaics, Stoics and Epicureans, Plato and
Aristotle represent the various philosophic answers to these
alternatives. Cynics and Cyrenaics both answer (1) by
individualism, but diverge on (2), the Cynics placing emphasis
on independence from wants, the Cyrenaics on gratification
of wants. Stoics and Epicureans represent
broader and more social development of the same principles,
the Stoics seeking a cosmopolitan state, the Epicureans
a community of friends; the Stoics emphasizing
reason or wisdom as the only good; the Epicureans finding
for wisdom a field in the selection of refined pleasures.
Plato and Aristotle, with varying emphasis but essential
agreement, insist (1) that the good of man is found in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
fulfilling completely his highest possible functions, which
is possible only in society; (2) that wisdom is not merely
to apply a standard but to form one; that while neither
reason alone nor feeling alone is enough for life, yet that
pleasure is rather for life than life for pleasure. Finally,
Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics, as well as the tragic poets,
contribute successively to the formation of an ideal of
responsible character.</p>

<p><b>Early Individualistic Theories.</b>&mdash;Cynics and Cyrenaics
were alike individualists. Society, they held, is artificial.
Its so-called goods, on the one hand, and its restrictions
on the other, are to be rejected unless they favor the
individual's happiness. Independence was the mark of wisdom
among the Cynics; Antisthenes, proud of the holes in
his garment; Diogenes, dwelling in his tent or sleeping in
the street, scoffing at the current "conventions" of decency,
asking from Philip only that he would get out of his sunshine&mdash;are
the characteristic figures. The "state of nature"
was opposed to the State. Only the primitive wants
were recognized as natural. "Art and science, family and
native land, were indifferent. Wealth and refinement, fame
and honor, seemed as superfluous as those enjoyments of
the senses which went beyond the satisfaction of the natural
wants of hunger and sex."</p>

<p>The Cyrenaics, or hedonists (<i>h&#275;don&#275;</i>, pleasure), gave a
different turn to wisdom. The good is pleasure, and wisdom
is found in that prudence which selects the purest and
most intense. Hence, if this is the good, why should a man
trouble himself about social standards or social obligations?
"The hedonists gladly shared the refinement of enjoyment
which civilization brought with it; they found it
convenient and permissible that the intelligent man should
enjoy the honey which others prepared; but no feeling of
duty or thankfulness bound them to the civilization whose
fruits they enjoyed. Sacrifice for others, patriotism, and
devotion to a general object, Theodorus declared to be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
form of foolishness which it did not become the wise man to
share."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 5. THE DEEPER VIEW OF NATURE AND THE GOOD; OF THE
INDIVIDUAL AND THE SOCIAL ORDER</h4>

<p><b>Value of a State.</b>&mdash;Plato and Aristotle take up boldly
the challenge of individualism. It may indeed be granted
that existing states are too often ruled by classes. There
are oligarchies in which the soldier or the rich control for
their own interests; there are tyrannies in which the despot
is greed and force personified; there are democracies
(Plato was an aristocrat) in which the mob bears rule,
and those who flatter and feed its passions are in authority.
But all these do but serve to bring out more clearly the
conception of a true State, in which the rule is by the wisest
and best and is not for the interest of a class, but for the
welfare of all. Even as it was, the State of Athens
in Plato's day&mdash;except when it condemned a Socrates&mdash;meant
completeness and freedom of life. It represented
not merely a police force to protect the individual, but stood
for the complete organization of all the life which needs
co&ouml;peration and mutual support. The State provided instruction
for the mind and training for the body. It
surrounded the citizen with an atmosphere of beauty and
provided in the tragedy and comedy opportunities for
every citizen to consider the larger significance of life or to
join in the contagious sympathy of mirth. In festivals
and solemn processions it brought the citizen into unity
of religious feeling. To be an Athenian citizen meant to
share in all the higher possibilities which life afforded. Interpreting
this life, Aristotle proclaims that it is not in
isolation, but in the State, that "the goal of full independence
may be said to be first attained."</p>

<p><b>The Natural.</b>&mdash;Aristotle goes directly to the heart of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the problem as to what is natural by asserting that
nature is not to be found in the crude beginning, but
rather in the complete development. "The nature of
anything, e.g., of a man, a horse, or a house, may
be defined to be its condition when the process of production
is complete." Hence the State "in which alone completeness
of life is attained" is in the highest sense natural:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The object proposed or the complete development of a
thing is its highest good; but independence which is first
attained in the State is a complete development or the highest
good and is therefore natural." "For as the State was formed
to make life possible, so it exists to make life good."</p>

<p>"Thus we see that the State is a natural institution, that
man is naturally a political animal and that one who is not a
citizen of any State, if the cause of his isolation be natural
and not accidental, is either a superhuman being or low in
the scale of human civilization, as he stands alone like a 'blot'
on the backgammon board. The 'clanless, lawless, hearthless
man,' so bitterly described by Homer, is a case in point, for
he is naturally a citizen of no state and a lover of war."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p></div>

<p>Nor does Aristotle stop here. With a profound insight
into the relation of man to society, and the dependence of
the individual upon the social body, a relation which modern
social psychology has worked out in greater detail,
Aristotle asserts that the State is not merely the goal of the
individual's development, but the source of his life.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Again, in the order of nature the State is prior to the
household or individual. For the whole must needs be prior
to its part. For instance, if you take away the body which
is the whole, there will not remain any such thing as a hand
or foot, unless we use the same word in a different sense, as
when we speak of a stone hand as a hand. For a hand
separated from the body will be a disabled hand; whereas it
is the faculty or function of a thing which makes it what it is,
and therefore when things lose their function or faculty, it
is not correct to call them the same things, but rather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>homonymous, i.e., different things having the same name. We
see, then, the State is a natural institution, and also that it
is prior to the individual. For if the individual as a separate
unit is not independent, he must be a part and must bear the
same relation to the State as the other parts to their wholes;
and one who is incapable of association with others or is
independent and has no need of such association, is no member
of a State; in other words, he is either a brute or a God."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p></div>

<p>And, moreover, when we look into the nature of the individual,
we do not find him a being devoid of the sympathies
and qualities which find their natural expression not only
in the State, but in various social and friendly relations.
There is "an impulse toward the life in common" (&#966;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;)
which expresses itself in friendship, but which is also so
essential to that recognition of others called justice that
we may say "it is the most just of all just things." There
is also a unity of disposition and purpose (&#8001;&#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;) which
may be called "political friendship."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><b>Plato's Ideal State.</b>&mdash;How then is the State constituted
and governed which is to provide for man's full development,
his complete good? Evidently two principles must
control. In the first place, it must be so constituted that
every man may develop in it the full capacities of his nature,
and thereby serve at once the perfection of the State
and his own completeness; and in the second place, the State
or social whole must be ruled by those best fitted for this
work. Not the soldier, nor the plutocrat, nor the artisan,
but the man who knows, is the suitable ruler for our ideal
community. The soldier may defend, the artisan may support,
but the scientific or intelligent man should rule. And
it is evident that in settling this principle, we have also answered
our first problem; for the soldier and the artisan
will find his full development by doing the work which he
can do well, not by meddling with a task in which he must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
necessarily fail. In order to guard against the greed
which was so characteristic of the governments of his day,
Plato would provide that the rulers and warriors should
have no private property, and not even private families.
Their eye should be single to the good of the whole. When
asked as to the practicability of a State governed by such
disinterested rulers, and with such wisdom, he admits indeed
its difficulty, but he stoutly demands its necessity:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes
of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy,
and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those
commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the
other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never have
rest from their evils,&mdash;no, nor the human race, as I believe,&mdash;and
then only will this our State have a possibility of life and
behold the light of day."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p></div>

<p>And yet the question of the actual existence of a perfect
State is not the question of supreme importance. For Plato
has grasped the thought that man is controlled not only
by what he sees, but by what he images as desirable. And
if a man has once formed the image of an ideal State or
city of this kind, in which justice prevails, and life reaches
fuller and higher possibilities than it has yet attained, this
is the main thing:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In heaven, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks,
which he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set
his own house in order. But whether such an one exists, or
ever will exist in fact, is no matter: for he will live after the
manner of that city, having nothing to do with any other."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p></div>

<p><b>The Social as Law of Nature.</b>&mdash;The social nature of
man, thus vindicated by Plato and Aristotle, remained as
the permanent possession of Greek thought. Even the
Epicureans, who developed further the hedonistic theory of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
life, emphasized the values of friendship as among the
choicest and most refined sources of pleasure. The Stoics,
who in their independence of wants took up the tradition of
the Cynics, were yet far from interpreting this as an independence
of society. The disintegration of the Greek
states made it impossible to find the social body in the old
city-state, and so we find with the Stoics a certain cosmopolitanism.
It is the highest glory of man to be a citizen
not of Athens but of the universe,&mdash;not of the city of Cecrops,
but of the city of Zeus. And through this conception
the social nature of man was made the basis of a "natural
law," which found its expression in the principles of
Roman and modern jurisprudence.</p>

<p><b>Passion or Reason.</b>&mdash;In answering the question as to
the true nature of man, Plato and Aristotle found the suggestions
likewise for the problem of individual good. For
if the soldier as the seeker for fame and honor, the avaricious
man embodying the desire for wealth, and still more,
the tyrant personifying the unbridled expression of every
lust and passion, are abhorrent, is it not easy to see that
an orderly and harmonious development of impulses under
the guidance and control of reason, is far better than that
uncramped expression of desires and cravings for which
some of the radical individualists and sensualists of the
day were clamoring? As representative of this class, hear
Callicles:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I plainly assert that he who would truly live ought to
allow his desires to wax to the uttermost, and not to chastise
them; but when they have grown to their greatest, he should
have courage and intelligence to minister to them and to
satisfy all his longings. And this I affirm to be natural justice
and nobility." The temperate man is a fool. It is only in
hungering and eating, in thirsting and drinking, in having
all his desires about him, and gratifying every possible desire,
that man lives happily.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>But even Callicles himself admits that there are certain
men, the creatures of degraded desire, whose lives are not
ideal, and hence that there must be some choice of pleasure.
And carrying out in the individual life the thought above
suggested by the State, Plato raises the question as to
whether man, a complex being, with both noble and ignoble
impulses, and with the capacity of controlling reason, can
be said to make a wise choice if he lets the passions run
riot and choke out wholly his rational nature:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man,
or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that which subjects
the man to the beast? He can hardly avoid admitting
this,&mdash;can he now? Not if he has any regard for my opinion.
But, if he admits this, we may ask him another question:
How would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the
condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the
worst? Who can imagine that a man who sold his son or
daughter into slavery for money, especially if he sold them
into the hands of fierce and evil men, would be the gainer,
however large might be the sum which he received? And will
any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who sells his own
divine being to that which is most atheistical and detestable
and has no pity? Eriphyle took the necklace as the price of
her husband's life, but he is taking a bribe in order to compass
a worse ruin."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p></div>

<p><b>Necessity of a Standard for Pleasure.</b>&mdash;If, for the
moment, we rule out the question of what is noble or
"kalon," and admit that the aim of life is to live pleasantly,
or if, in other words, it is urged as above that justice
is not profitable and that hence he who would seek the
highest good will seek it by some other than the thorny
path, we must recognize that the decision as to which kind
of pleasure is preferable will depend on the character of
the man who judges:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Then we may assume that there are three classes of men,&mdash;lovers
of wisdom, lovers of ambition, lovers of gain? Exactly.
And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>several objects? Very true. Now, if you examine the three
classes and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest,
each of them will be found praising his own and deprecating
that of others; the money-maker will contrast the
vanity of honor or of learning with the solid advantages of
gold and silver? True, he said. And the lover of honor,&mdash;what
will be his opinion? Will he not think that the pleasure
of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, which has
no need of honor, he regards as all smoke and nonsense?
True, he said. But may we not suppose, I said, that philosophy
estimates other pleasures as nothing in comparison with
knowing the truth, and in that abiding, ever learning, in the
pursuit of truth, not far indeed from the heaven of pleasure?
The other pleasures the philosopher disparages by calling
them necessary, meaning that if there were no necessity for
them, he would not have them. There ought to be no doubt
about that, he replied. Since, then, the pleasure of each class
and the life of each is in dispute, and the question is not which
life is most honorable, or better or worse, but which is the
more pleasant or painless,&mdash;how shall we know? I cannot
tell, he said. Well, but what ought to be the criterion? Is
any better than experience and wisdom and reason? There
cannot be a better, he said. If wealth and gain were the
criterion, then what the lover of gain praised and blamed
would surely be the truest? Assuredly. Of if honor or
victory or courage, in that case the ambitions or contentments
would decide best? Clearly. But since experience and
wisdom and reason are the judges, the inference of course is,
that the truest pleasures are those which are approved by the
lover of wisdom and reason."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p></div>

<p>It is thus evident that even if we start out to find the
good in pleasure, we need some kind of measuring art. We
need a "standard for pleasure," and this standard can be
found only in wisdom. And this forces us to maintain that
wisdom is after all <i>the</i> good. Not merely intellectual attainment&mdash;a
life of intellect without feeling would be just
as little a true human life as would the life of an oyster,
which has feeling with no intelligence. A life which includes
sciences and arts, and the pure pleasures of beauty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
presided over by wisdom and measure and symmetry,&mdash;this
is Plato's vision of the life of the individual, viewed from
within.</p>

<p><b>Eudaemonism.</b>&mdash;Aristotle's conception of the good is
fundamentally the same. It is a full development of man's
capacities, culminating in a rational and harmonious life.
If, says Aristotle, we are to find the ultimate good, we must
try to find, if possible, some one end which is pursued as an
end in itself, and never as a means to something else, and
the most general term for this final end is "eudaimonia,"
or well-being, "for we also choose it for itself and never for
the sake of something else." What is the essence of well-being?
This, according to Aristotle, is to be found by asking
what is the function of man. The life of nutrition and
growth man has in common with the plants; the life of
sense in common with the animal. It is in the life of his rational
nature that we must find his especial function. "The
good of man is exercise of his faculties in accordance with
their appropriate excellence." External goods are valuable
because they may be instruments toward such full
activity. Pleasure is to be valued because it "perfects the
activities, and therefore perfects life, which is the aim of
human desire"&mdash;rather than valued as an end in itself.
No one would choose to live on condition of having a child's
intellect all his life, though he were to enjoy in the highest
possible degree all the pleasures of a child.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><b>The "Mean."</b>&mdash;The crowning importance of wisdom as
the rational measure of the ideal life is also illustrated in
Aristotle's theory of excellence (or virtue) as a "mean".
This phrase is somewhat ambiguous, for some passages
would seem to indicate that it is merely striking an average
between two kinds of excesses, and finding, as it were,
a moderate amount of feeling or action; but there is evidently
involved here just the old thought of measure, and
"the mean is what right reason prescribes." It is not every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
one who can find the mean, but only he who has the requisite
knowledge. The supreme excellence or virtue is, therefore,
the wisdom which can find the true standard for
action.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p><b>The Wise Man.</b>&mdash;Finally the conception of virtue as
wisdom is illustrated in the ideals of the three prominent
schools in later Greek thought,&mdash;the Sceptics, Epicureans,
and Stoics. The wise man among Sceptics is he who
suspends judgment where it is impossible to be certain.
The wise man among Epicureans is he who chooses the finest
and surest and most lasting pleasures. The wise man
among Stoics is he who overcomes his emotions. But in
every case the ideal is expressed in the same phrase, "the
wise man."</p>

<p><b>Man and the Cosmos.</b>&mdash;We see thus how Greek
thought, starting out to challenge all society's laws and
standards and bring them to the bar of knowledge, has
found a deeper value and higher validity in the true social
and moral order. The appeal was to the C&aelig;sar of reason,
and reason taken in its full significance carries us beyond
the immediate and transient to the broader and more permanent
good. Nor can reason in its search for good be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
content, urges Plato, with the superficial facts of life and
society. He who would find and achieve his complete function,
his full development, must broaden his horizon still
further. As his own particular life is but a part of the ongoing
of the larger world, whose forces act upon him, limit
him, and determine his possibilities, it becomes absolutely
necessary to study not merely his own end and purpose, but
the end and purpose of the universe. Human good requires
us to know the larger good, <i>the</i> Good, in the full and complete
sense. And this perfect Good which is, in truth, the
very essence of the universe, is but another term for God,
and Plato often uses the two as interchangeable terms.</p>

<p>So the "Nature" which Greek life was seeking gets its
deepest significance and reinterprets the old religious demand
for unity of the life of man with the forces of the
unseen. And the Stoic later, in his maxim "Follow Nature,"
gives more explicit recognition to the return of the circle.
For the great work of Greek science had brought out into
complete clearness the idea of Nature as a system of law.
The universe is a rational universe, a cosmos, and man, as
above all else a rational being, finds thus his kinship to the
universe. To follow Nature, therefore, means to know the
all-pervading law of Nature and submit to it in calm acceptance
or resignation.</p>

<p>"All is harmonious to me that is harmonious to thee, O
universe; all is fruit to me which thy seasons bring."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 6. THE CONCEPTION OF THE IDEAL</h4>

<p><b>Contrast of Actual and Ideal.</b>&mdash;The two stages of
Greek thought which we have sketched did more than to readjust
Greek life to deeper views of the State and the individual;
of the good and of nature. The very challenge
and process brought into explicit consciousness a new
feature of the moral life, which is fundamental to true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
moral consciousness, viz., the factor of contrast between
the actual and the ideal. We have seen that the clash of
one-sided interests and political institutions and, in the case
of Plato, the tragic execution of Socrates, obliged Plato
and Aristotle to admit that the actual State did not subserve
the real purpose which they were forced to seek in
social organization. Both Plato and Aristotle, therefore,
draw the picture of a State that should serve the complete
purposes of human development. And again, in the individual
life, both the conception of the development of man's
highest possibilities and the conception of a measure or
standard for the conflicting desires and purposes lead on
to a conception which shall embody not merely the existing
status but the goal of yet unrealized purpose.</p>

<p><b>The Ideal as the True Reality.</b>&mdash;Various qualities and
aspirations are embodied by Plato in this conception, and
with characteristic Greek genius he has given to this conception
of the ideal almost as concrete and definite a form
as the Greek sculptor of Apollo gave to his ideal of light
and clarity, or the sculptor of Aphrodite to the conception
of grace. As contrasted with the flux of transient emotions,
or the uncertain play of half-comprehended or futile
goods, this ideal good is conceived as eternal, unchanging,
ever the same. It is superhuman and divine. As contrasted
with various particular and partial goods on which
the sons of men fix their affections, it is the one universal
good which is valid for all men everywhere and forever.
In his effort to find suitable imagery for this conception,
Plato was aided by the religious conceptions of the Orphic
and Pythagorean societies, which had emphasized the pre-existence
and future existence of the soul, and its distinction
from the body. In its previous life, said Plato,
the soul has had visions of a beauty, a truth, and a goodness
of which this life affords no adequate examples. And
with this memory within it of what it has looked upon before,
it judges the imperfect and finite goods of this present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
world and longs to fly away again and be with God. This
thought of contrast between ideal and actual, to which
Plato in some of his writings gave the turn of a contrast
between soul and body, passed on with increased emphasis
into Stoic and later Platonist schools, and furnished a philosophic
basis for the dualism and asceticism which is found
in Hellenistic and medi&aelig;val morality.</p>

<p><b>Ethical Significance.</b>&mdash;While the true ethical contrast
between the actual and the ideal was thus shifted over into
a metaphysical contrast between soul and body, or between
what is fixed and what is changing, the fundamental
thought is highly significant, for it merely symbolizes
in objective form the characteristic of every moral
judgment, viz., the testing and valuing of an act by some
standard, and what is even more important, the forming
of a standard by which to do the testing. Even Aristotle,
who is frequently regarded as the mere describer of what
is, rather than the idealistic portrayer of what ought to
be, is no less insistent upon the significance of the ideal.
In fact, his isolation of reflection or <i>theoria</i> from the civic
virtues was used by the medi&aelig;val church in its idealization
of the "contemplative life." Like Plato, he conceives the
ideal as a divine element in human nature:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nevertheless, instead of listening to those who advise us as
men and mortals not to lift our thoughts above what is human
and mortal, we ought rather, as far as possible, to put off our
mortality and make every effort to live in the exercise of the
highest of our faculties; for though it be but a small part of
us, yet in power and value it far surpasses all the rest."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p></div>


<h4>&sect; 7. THE CONCEPTION OF THE SELF; OF CHARACTER AND
RESPONSIBILITY</h4>

<p><b>The Poets.</b>&mdash;Out of the fierce competition of individual
desires, the clashing of individual ambitions, the conflict<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
between the individual and the state, and the deepening of
the conception of the individual's "nature," emerged also
another conception of fundamental importance for the
more highly developed reflective moral life, viz., that
of the moral personality, its character and its responsibility.
We may trace the development of this conception
through the poets, as well as in the philosophers. &AElig;schylus
set man over against the gods, subject to their divine
laws, but gave little play to human character or conscious
self-direction. With Sophocles, the tragic situation
was brought more directly into the field of human character,
although the conception of destiny and the limitations
marked thereby were still the dominant note. With Euripides,
human emotions and character are brought into the
foreground. Stout-heartedness, the high spirit that can
endure in suffering or triumph in death, which shows not
merely in his heroes but in the women, Polyxena and Medea,
Ph&aelig;dra and Iphigenia, evinces the growing consciousness
of the self&mdash;a consciousness which will find further
development in the proud and self-sufficient endurance of
the Stoic. In more directly ethical lines, we find increasing
recognition of the self in the motives which are set up
for human action, and in the view which is formed of
human character. Conscience in the earlier poets and moralists,
was largely a compound of Nemesis, the external
messenger and symbol of divine penalty, on the one hand,
and Aidos, the sense of respect or reverence for public
opinion and for the higher authority of the gods, on the
other. But already in the tragedians we find suggestions
of a more intimate and personal conception. Pains sent by
Zeus in dreams may lead the individual to meditate, and
thus to better life. Neoptolemus, in Sophocles, says,</p>

<p class="poem">
"All things are noisome when a man deserts<br />
His own true self and does what is not meet."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">and Philoctetes replies,</p>

<p class="poem">
"Have mercy on me, boy, by all the gods,<br />
And do not shame thyself by tricking me."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p class="noidt">The whole <i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles is the struggle between
obedience to the political rulers and obedience to the higher
laws which as "laws of reverence" become virtually inner
laws of duty:</p>

<p class="poem">
"I know I please the souls I ought to please."<br />
</p>

<p><b>Plato.</b>&mdash;Here, as in the formulation of his conception of
the ideal, religious imagery helped Plato to find a more objective
statement for the conception of a moral judgment
and a moral character. In the final judgment of the soul
after death, Plato sees the real self stripped bare of all
external adornments of beauty, rank, power, or wealth,
and standing as naked soul before the naked judge, to receive
his just reward. And the very nature of this reward
or penalty shows the deepening conception of the self, and
of the intrinsic nature of moral character. The true penalty
of injustice is not to be found in anything external,
but in the very fact that the evil doers become base and
wicked:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They do not know the penalty of injustice, which above
all things they ought to know,&mdash;not stripes and death, as they
suppose, which evil doers often escape, but a penalty which
cannot be escaped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theod.</span> What is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soc.</span> There are two patterns set before them in nature; the
one blessed and divine, the other godless and wretched; and
they do not see, in their utter folly and infatuation, that they
are growing like the one and unlike the other, by reason of
their evil deeds; and the penalty is that they lead a life
answering to the pattern which they resemble."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p></div>

<p><b>The Stoics.</b>&mdash;It is, however, in the Stoics that we find
the conception of inner reflection reaching clearest expression.
Seneca and Epictetus repeat again and again
the thought that the conscience is of higher importance
than any external judgment,&mdash;that its judgment is inevitable.
In these various conceptions, we see attained the
third stage of Adam Smith's description of the formation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
of conscience.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Man who read his duty at first in the judgments
of his fellows, in the customs and laws and codes of
honor, and in the religious precepts of the gods, has again
come to find in gods and laws, in custom and authority, the
true rational law of life; but it is now a law of self. Not
a particular or individual self, but a self which embraces
within it at once the human and the divine. The individual
has become social and has recognized himself as such.
The religious, social, and political judgments have become
the judgments of man upon himself. "Duty," what is
binding or necessary, takes its place as a definite moral
conception.</p>

as exemplifying this principle, the quality of high-mindedness
(&#956;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#968;&#965;&#967;&#943;&#945;)
is pre-eminent, and may be taken as embodying the trait
most prized in an Athenian gentleman. The high-minded man claims
much and deserves much; lofty in his standard of honor and excellence
he accepts tributes from good men as his just desert, but
despises honor from ordinary men or on trivial grounds; good and
evil fortune are alike of relatively small importance. He neither
seeks nor fears danger; he is ready to confer favors and forget
injuries, slow to ask favors or cry for help; fearless in his love and
hatred, in his truth and his independence of conduct; "not easily
moved to admiration, for nothing is great to him. He loves to
possess beautiful things that bring no profit, rather than useful
things that pay; for this is characteristic of the man whose resources
are in himself. Further, the character of the high-minded man seems
to require that his gait should be slow, his voice deep, his speech
measured; for a man is not likely to be in a hurry when there
are few things in which he is deeply interested, nor excited when he
holds nothing to be of very great importance; and these are the
causes of a high voice and rapid movements" (<i>Ethics</i>, IV., vi.-viii.).</p></div>

<br /><br />

THE MODERN PERIOD</h2>


<p>The moral life of the modern western world differs from
both Hebrew and Greek morality in one respect. The Hebrews
and Greeks were pioneers. Their leaders had to
meet new situations and shape new conceptions of righteousness
and wisdom. Modern civilization and morality,
on the other hand, received certain ideals and standards
already worked out and established. These came to it
partly through the literature of Hebrews, Greeks, and
Latins, partly through Greek art and Roman civilization,
but chiefly, perhaps, through two institutions: (1) Roman
government and law embodied Stoic conceptions of a natural
law of reason and of a world state, a universal rational
society. This not only gave the groundwork of government
and rights to the modern world; it was a constant
influence for guiding and shaping ideas of authority
and justice. (2) The Christian Church in its cathedrals,
its cloisters, its ceremonials, its orders, and its doctrines had
a most impressive system of standards, valuations, motives,
sanctions, and prescriptions for action. These were
not of Hebrew origin solely. Greek and Roman philosophy
and political conceptions were fused with more primitive
teaching and conduct. When the Germans conquered
the Empire they accepted in large measure its institutions
and its religion. Modern morality, like modern civilization,
shows the mingled streams of Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and
German or Celtic life. It contains also conceptions due
to the peculiar industrial, scientific, and political development
of modern times. Thus we have to-day such inherited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
standards as that of "the honor of a gentleman" side by
side with the modern class standard of business honesty,
and the labor union ideal of class solidarity. We have the
aristocratic ideals of chivalry and charity side by side with
more democratic standards of domestic and social justice.
We find the Christian equal standard for the two sexes
side by side with another which sets a high value on woman's
chastity, but a trivial value on man's. We find a
certain ideal of self-sacrifice side by side with an ideal of
"success" as the only good. We cannot hope to disentangle
all the threads that enter this variegated pattern,
or rather collection of patterns, but we can point out certain
features that at the same time illustrate certain general
lines of development. We state first the general attitude
and ideals of the Middle Ages, and then the three lines
along which individualism has proceeded to the moral consciousness
of to-day.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. THE MEDI&AElig;VAL IDEALS</h4>

<p>The medi&aelig;val attitude toward life was determined in part
by the character of the Germanic tribes with their bold,
barbaric strength and indomitable spirit, their clan and
other group organizations, their customs or mores belonging
to such a stock; and in part by the religious ideals
presented in the church. The presence of these two factors
was manifest in the strong contrasts everywhere present.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Associated with mail-clad knights whose trade is war and
whose delight is to combat are the men whose sacred vocation
forbids the use of force altogether. Through lands
overspread with deeds of violence, the lonely wayfarer with
the staff and badge of a pilgrim passes unarmed and in safety.
In sight of castles, about whose walls fierce battles rage, are
the church and the monastery, within the precincts of which
quiet reigns and all violence is branded as sacrilege."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p></div>

<p>The harsh clashes of the Venus music over against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the solemn strains from the Pilgrim's Chorus in Tannh&auml;user
might well symbolize not only the specific collision
of the opera but the broader range of passions opposed
to the religious controls and values in this medi&aelig;val
society.</p>

<p><b>The Group and Class Ideal.</b>&mdash;The early Germans and
Celts in general had the clan system, the group ideals,
and group virtues which belonged to other Aryan peoples,
but the very fact of the Germanic victories shows
a military spirit which included both personal heroism
and good capacity for organization. Group loyalty was
strong, and the group valuation of strength and courage
was unbounded. A high value was also set on woman's
chastity. These qualities, particularly the loyalty
to the clan and its head, survived longest in Celtic
peoples like the Scots and Irish who were not subjected
to the forces of political organization. Every reader of
Scott is familiar with the values and defects of the type;
and the problems which it causes in modern democracy have
been acutely described by Jane Addams.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Among the
Germanic peoples, when the clan and tribal systems were
followed by the more thoroughgoing demarcation of
classes, free and serfs, lords and villains, chevalier or
knight, and churl, the old Latin terms "gentle" and "vulgar"
found a fitting application. The term "gentle"
was indeed given in one of its usages the force of the
kindred term "kind" to characterize the conduct appropriate
within the kin, but in the compound "gentleman"
it formed one of the most interesting conceptions of class
morality. The "honor" of a gentleman was determined
by what the class demanded. Above all else the gentleman
must not show fear. He must be ready to fight at
any instant to prove his courage. His word must not
be doubted. This seems to have been on the ground that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
such doubt would be a refusal to take the man at his own
estimate, rather than because of any superlative love of
truth, for the approved way to prove the point at issue was
by fighting, not by any investigation. But the class character
appears in the provision that no insult from one of
a lower class need be noticed. Homicide was not contrary
to the character and honor of a gentleman. Nor did this
require any such standard in sex relations as a "woman's
honor" requires of a woman. In conduct toward others,
the "courtesy" which expresses in ceremony and manner
respect for personal dignity was a fine trait. It
did not always prevent insolence toward inferiors, although
there was in many cases the feeling, <i>noblesse oblige</i>. What
was needed to make this ideal of gentleman a moral and
not merely a class ideal, was that it should base treatment
of others on personal worth rather than on birth, or
wealth, or race, and that it should not rate reputation for
courage above the value of human life. This has been
in part effected, but many traits of the old conception
live on to-day.</p>

<p><b>The Ideal of the Church.</b>&mdash;The ideal of life which the
church presented contained two strongly contrasting
elements, which have been frequently found in religion
and are perhaps inevitably present. On the one hand, a
spiritual religion implies that man in comparison with
God is finite, weak, and sinful; he should therefore be of
"a humble and contrite heart." On the other hand, as a
child of God he partakes of the divine and is raised to
infinite worth. On the one hand, the spiritual life is not
of this world and must be sought in renouncing its pleasures
and lusts; on the other hand, if God is really the
supreme governor of the universe, then this world also
ought to be subject to his rule. In the medi&aelig;val view of
life, the humility and withdrawal from the world were
assigned to the individual; the sublimity and the ruling
authority to the church. Ethically this distribution had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
somewhat the effect of group morality in that it minimized
the individual and magnified the corporate body
of which he was a part. Asceticism and humility go hand
in hand with the power of the hierarchy. Individual
poverty&mdash;wealth of the church; individual meekness and
submission&mdash;unlimited power and authority in the church;
these antitheses reflect the fact that the church was the heir
both of a kingdom of God and of a Roman Empire. The
humility showed itself in extreme form in the ascetic type
of monasticism with its vows of poverty, chastity, and
obedience. It was reflected in the art which took for its
subjects the saints, conceived not individually, but typically
and according to tradition and authority. Their thin
attenuated figures showed the ideal prescribed. The same
humility showed itself in the intellectual sphere in the
pre&euml;minence given to faith as compared with reason, while
the mystic losing himself in God showed yet another phase
of individual renunciation. Even charity, with which the
church sought to temper the hardship of the time, took
a form which tended to maintain or even applaud the
dependent attitude of the recipient. So far as life for
the individual had a positive value, this lay not in living
oneself out, but rather in the calm and the support afforded
by the church:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A life in the church, for the church, through the church;
a life which she blessed in mass at morning and sent to peaceful
rest by the vesper hymn; a life which she supported by
the constantly recurring stimulus of the sacraments, relieving
it by confession, purifying it by penance, admonishing it by
the presentation of visible objects for contemplation and worship&mdash;this
was the life which they of the Middle Ages conceived
of as the rightful life of man; it was the actual life
of many, the ideal of all."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p></div>

<p>On the other side, the church boldly asserted the right
and duty of the divine to control the world,&mdash;the reli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>gious
symbol of the modern proposition that conscience
should dominate political and business affairs. "No institution
is apart from the authority of the church," wrote
&AElig;gidius Colonna. "No one can legitimately possess field
or vine except under its authority or by it. Heretics are
not owners, but unjustly occupy." Canossa symbolized
the supremacy of the spiritual over the temporal power,
and there is a sublime audacity, moral as well as political,
in the famous Bull of Boniface VIII., "We declare that
every human creature is subject to the Roman pontiff."</p>

<p>The church as a corporate society expressed also the
<i>community</i> of its members. It was indeed no mere collection
of individual believers. As a divine institution,
the "body of Christ on earth," it gave to its members
rather than received from them. It invested them with
new worth, instead of getting its own worth from them.
Nevertheless, it was not an absolute authority; it represented
the union of all in a common fellowship, a common
destiny, and a common cause against the powers
of evil.</p>

<p>The massive cathedrals which remain as the monuments
of the ages of faith, are fitting symbols of these
aspects of medi&aelig;val life. They dominate their cities
architecturally, as the church dominated the life of the
ages which built them. They inspired within the worshipper,
on the one hand, a sense of finiteness in the presence
of the sublime; on the other, an elevation of soul
as he became conscious of union with a power and presence
not his own. They awed the worshiping assembly
and united it in a common service.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. MAIN LINES OF MODERN DEVELOPMENT</h4>

<p>We have seen that the medi&aelig;val life had two sets of
standards and values: one set by the tribal codes and the
instinct of a warlike people; the other set by a church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
which required renunciation while it asserted control.
Changes may be traced in both ideals. The group morality
becomes refined and broadened. The church standards
are affected in four ways: (a) The goods of the secular
life, art, family, power, wealth, claim a place in the system
of values. (b) Human authority asserts itself, at
first in sovereign states with monarchs, then in the growth
of civil liberty and political democracy. (c) Instead of
faith, reason asserts itself as the agency for discovering
the laws of nature and of life. (d) As the result of the
greater dignity and worth of the individual which is
worked out in all these lines, social virtue tends to lay
less value on charity and more on social justice.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the movements to be
outlined have resulted in the displacement or loss of
the positive values in the religious ideal. The morality
of to-day does not ignore spiritual values; it aims rather
to use them to give fuller meaning to all experience. It
does not abandon law in seeking freedom, or ignore
duty because it is discovered by reason. Above all, it
is seeking to bring about in more intimate fashion that
supremacy of the moral order in all human relations for
which the church was theoretically contending. And in
recent times we are appreciating more thoroughly that
the individual cannot attain a full moral life by himself.
Only as he is a member of a moral society can he find
scope and support for full development of will. In concrete
phrase, it is just as necessary to improve the general
social environment in which men, women, and children
are to live, in order to make better individuals, as it
is to improve the individuals in order to get a better
society. This was a truth which the religious conception
of salvation through the church taught in other
terms.</p>

<p>To follow the development of the modern moral consciousness,
we shall rely not so much on the formal writ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>ings
of moral philosophers as on other sources. What men
value most, and what they recognize as right, is shown
in what they work for and fight for and in how they spend
their leisure. This is reflected more immediately in their
laws, their art and literature, their religion, and their
educational institutions, although it finds ultimate expression
in moral theories. The more concrete aspects are
suggested in this chapter, the theories in Chapter XII.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. THE OLD AND NEW IN THE BEGINNINGS OF
INDIVIDUALISM</h4>

<p>An interesting blending of the class ideal of the warrior
and "gentleman" with the religious ideals of devotion to
some spiritual service, and of protection to the weak, is
afforded by <i>chivalry</i>. The knights show their faith by
their deeds of heroism, not by renunciation. But they
fight for the Holy Sepulcher, or for the weak and oppressed.
Their investiture is almost as solemn as that
of a priest. Honor and love appear as motives side by
side with the quest of the Holy Grail. Chevalier Bayard
is the gallant fighter for country, but he is also the
passionate admirer of justice, the knight <i>sans peur et
sans reproche</i>. Moreover, the literature which embodies
the ideal exhibits not only feats of arms and religious
symbolism. Parsifal is not a mere abstraction; he has
life and character. "And who will deny," writes Francke,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
"that in this character Wolfram has put before us, within
the forms of chivalrous life, an immortal symbol of
struggling, sinning, despairing, but finally redeemed,
humanity?"</p>

<p>If chivalry represented in some degree a moralizing
of the warrior class, the mendicant orders represented
an effort to bring religion into secular life. The followers
of St. Dominic and St. Francis were indeed ascetic, but
instead of maintaining the separate life of the cloister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
they aimed to awaken a personal experience among the
whole people. Further, the Dominicans adopted the methods
and conceptions of Greek philosophy to support the
doctrines of the church, instead of relying solely on faith.
The Franciscans on their part devoted an ecstatic type
of piety to deeds of charity and beneficence. They aimed
to overcome the world rather than to withdraw from it.
A bolder appeal to the individual, still within the sphere
of religion, was made when Wyclif asserted the right of
every instructed man to search the Bible for himself,
and a strong demand for social justice found expression in
Wyclif's teaching as well as in the vision of Piers Plowman.</p>

<p>In the political world the growing strength of the
empire sought likewise a religious sanction in its claim of
a divine right, independent of the church. The claims of
the civic life find also increasing recognition with the
spiritual teachers.</p>

<p>The State had been regarded by Augustine as a consequence
of the fall of man, but it now comes to claim
and receive a moral value: first, with Thomas Aquinas,
as the institution in which man perfects his earthly nature
and prepares for his higher destiny in the realm
of grace; then, with Dante, as no longer subordinate to
the church, but co&ouml;rdinate with it.</p>

<p>Finally, the rise of the universities shows a most significant
appearance of the modern spirit under the old
sanctions. The range of secular studies was limited and
the subject-matter to be studied was chiefly the doctrine
of the Fathers. The teachers who drew thousands of eager
young men about them were clerics. But the very fact
that dialectics&mdash;the art of reasoning&mdash;was the focus of
interest, shows the dawn of a spirit of inquiry. Such
a book as Abelard's <i>Sic et Non</i>, which marshaled the
opposing views of the Fathers in "deadly parallel," was
a challenge to tradition and an assertion of reason. And
it is not without significance that the same bold thinker was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the first of the medi&aelig;val scholars to treat ethics again as
a field by itself. The title "<i>Know Thyself</i>" suggests its
method. The essence of the moral act is placed in the
intent or resolve of the will; the criterion for judgment is
agreement or disagreement with conscience.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4. INDIVIDUALISM IN THE PROGRESS OF LIBERTY AND
DEMOCRACY</h4>

<p><b>Rights.</b>&mdash;It is not possible or necessary here to sketch the
advance of political and civil liberty. Finding its agents
sometimes in kings, sometimes in cities, sometimes in an
aristocracy or a House of Commons, and sometimes in a
popular uprising, it has also had as its defenders with
the pen, Churchmen, Protestants, and freethinkers, lawyers,
publicists, and philosophers. All that can be done
here is to indicate briefly the moral significance of the
movement. Some of its protagonists have been actuated
by conscious moral purpose. They have fought with
sword or pen not only in the conviction that their cause
was just, but because they believed it just. At other times,
a king has favored a city to weaken the power of the
nobility, or the Commons have opposed the king because
they objected to taxation. What makes the process significant
morally is that, whatever the motives actuating
those who have fought its battles with sword or pen, they
have nearly always claimed to be fighting for "rights."
They have professed the conviction that they are engaged
in a just cause. They have thus made appeal to a moral
standard, and in so far as they have sincerely sought to
assert rights, they have been recognizing in some sense
a social and rational standard; they have been building up
a moral personality. Sometimes indeed the rights have
been claimed as a matter of "possession" or of tradition.
This is to place them on the basis of customary
morality. But in such great crises as the English Revo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>lutions
of the seventeenth century, or the French and
American Revolutions of the eighteenth, some deeper basis
has been sought. A Milton, a Locke, a Rousseau, a Jefferson,
has but voiced the sentiments of a people in
formulating an explicitly moral principle. Sometimes this
has taken the form of an appeal to God-given rights. All
men are equal before God; why should one man assume to
command another because of birth? In this sense the
Puritans stood for liberty and democracy as part of their
creed of life. But often the appeal to a moral principle
borrowed the conceptions of Greek philosophy and Roman
law, and spoke of "natural rights" or a "law of nature."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><b>Natural Rights.</b>&mdash;This conception, as we have noted,
had its origin in Greece in the appeal from custom or convention
to Nature. At first an appeal to the natural
impulses and wants, it became with the Stoics an appeal
to the rational order of the universe. Roman jurists found
in the idea of such a law of nature the rational basis
for the law of society. Cicero had maintained that every
man had its principles innate within him. It is obvious
that here was a principle with great possibilities. The
Roman law itself was most often used in the interest of
absolutism, but the idea of a natural law, and so of a
natural right more fundamental than any human dictate,
proved a powerful instrument in the struggle for personal
rights and equality. "All men naturally were born free,"
wrote Milton. "To understand political power right,"
wrote Locke, "and derive it from its original, we must
consider what state all men are naturally in, and that is
a state of perfect freedom to order their actions and dispose
of their possessions and persons, as they think fit,
within the bounds of the law of nature; without asking
leave or depending on the will of any other man. A state
also of equality, wherein all the power and jurisdiction is
reciprocal."  These doctrines found eloquent portrayal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
in Rousseau, and appear in the Declaration of Independence
of 1776. Finally, the effort to find in nature some
basis for independence and freedom is given a new turn
by Herbert Spencer when he points to the instinct for
liberty in animals as well as in human beings as the origin
of the law of freedom.</p>

<p>By one of the paradoxes of history, the principle is now
most often invoked in favor of "vested interests." "Natural"
easily loses the force of an appeal to reason and
to social good, and becomes merely an assertion of ancient
usage, or precedent, or even a shelter for mere selfish
interests. Natural rights in property may be invoked
to thwart efforts to protect life and health. Individualism
has been so successful in asserting rights that it is
now apt to forget that there are no rights morally except
such as express the will of a good <i>member of society</i>. But
in recognizing possible excesses we need not forget the
value of the idea of rights as a weapon in the struggle
in which the moral personality has gradually won its
way. The other side of the story has been the growth
of responsibility. The gain in freedom has not meant
an increase in disorder; it has been marked rather by gain
in peace and security, by an increasing respect for law,
and an increasing stability of government. The external
control of force has been replaced by the moral control
of duty.</p>


<h4>&sect; 5. INDIVIDUALISM AS AFFECTED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF
INDUSTRY, COMMERCE, AND ART</h4>

<p>The development of industry, commerce, and art affects
the moral life in a variety of ways, of which three are of
especial importance for our purpose.</p>

<p>(1) It gives new interests, and new opportunities for
individual activity.</p>

<p>(2) This raises the question of <i>values</i>. Are all the ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>tivities
good, and shall one satisfy whatever interest
appeals to him, or are some better than others?&mdash;the old
question of "kinds of happiness."</p>

<p>(3) It raises further the question of sharing and distribution.
How far may one enjoy the goods of life in
an exclusive way and how far is it his duty to share with
others? Do society's present methods of industry, commerce,
art, and education distribute these goods in a
just manner?</p>

<p>The examination of these questions will be made in Part
III. It is our purpose at this point merely to indicate
the trend of the moral consciousness with regard to them.</p>

<p><b>1. The Increasing Power and Interests of the Individual.</b>&mdash;Power
for the medi&aelig;val man could be sought in
war or in the church; interests were correspondingly limited.
The Crusades, contact, through them and later
through commerce, with Arabian civilization, growing
acquaintance with the literature and art of Greece and
Rome, were effective agencies in stimulating the modern
development. But when once started it needed but the
opportunities of sufficient wealth and freedom to go on.
Art and letters have depicted a variety and richness of
experience which the ancient world did not feel. Shakspere,
Rembrandt, Bunyan, Beethoven, Goethe, Balzac,
Shelley, Byron, Hugo, Wagner, Ibsen, Thackeray, Eliot,
Tolstoy, to name almost at random, reflect a wealth of
interests and motives which show the range of the modern
man. Commerce and the various lines of industry have
opened new avenues for power. No one can see the palaces
or dwellings of Venice or the old Flemish ports, or consider
the enormous factories, shops, and office buildings
of to-day, without a sense of the accession to human
power over nature and over the activities of fellow men
which trade and industry have brought with them. The
use of money instead of a system of personal service&mdash;slavery
or serfdom&mdash;has not only made it possible to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
have men's labor without owning the men, it has aided in
a vastly more effective system than the older method
allowed. The industrial revolution of the past century
has had two causes: one the use of machinery; the other
the combination of human labor which this makes possible.
So far this has greatly increased the power of the
few leaders, but not of the many. It is the present problem
to make possible a larger opportunity for individual
freedom and power.</p>

<p><b>2. The Values of Art and Industry.</b>&mdash;Are all these wider
interests and fuller powers good? The church ideal
and the class ideal already described gave different
answers. The class ideal of gentleman really expressed a
form of self-assertion, of living out one's powers fully,
and this readily welcomed the possibilities which art and
its enjoyment afforded.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The gentleman of the Renaissance,
the cavalier of England, the noblesse of France,
were patrons of art and letters. The Romanticist urged
that such free and full expression as art afforded was
higher than morality with its control and limitation. The
church admitted art in the service of religion, but was
chary of it as an individual activity. The Puritans
were more rigorous. Partly because they associated its
churchly use with what they regarded as "idolatry,"
partly as a protest against the license in manners which
the freedom of art seemed to encourage, they frowned
upon all forms of art except sacred literature or music.
Their condemnation of the stage is still an element, though
probably a lessening element, and it is not long since fiction
was by many regarded with suspicion. On the whole,
the modern moral consciousness accepts art as having a
place in the moral life, although it by no means follows
that art can be exempt from moral criticism as to its sincerity,
healthfulness, and perspective.</p>

<p>In the case of industry the church ideal has prevailed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
The class ideal of gentleman was distinctly opposed to
industry, particularly manual labor. "Arms" or the
Court was the proper profession. This was more or less
bound up with the fact that in primitive conditions labor
was mainly performed by women or by slaves. It was the
business, the "virtue" of men to fight. So far as this
class ideal was affected by the models of ancient culture,
the prejudice was strengthened. The classic civilization
rested on slave labor. The ideal of the gentleman of
Athens was the free employment of leisure, not active
enterprise. The church, on the other hand, maintained
both the dignity and the moral value of labor. Not only
the example of the Founder of Christianity and his early
disciples, who were for the most part manual laborers, but
the intrinsic moral value of work, already referred to,
entered into the appraisal.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The Puritans, who have had
a wide-reaching influence upon the standards of the middle
and lower classes of England, and upon the northern and
western portions of America, were insistent upon industry,
not merely for the sake of its products,&mdash;they were frugal
in their consumption,&mdash;but as expressing a type of character.
Idleness and "shiftlessness" were not merely ineffective,
they were sinful. "If any will not work, neither
let him eat," commended itself thoroughly to this moral
ideal. That the laborer brought something to the common
weal, while the idler had to be supported, was a re&euml;nforcement
to the motives drawn from the relation of work to
character. As the middle and lower classes became increasingly
influential, the very fact that they were laborers
and traders strengthened the religious ideal by a class
motive. It was natural that a laboring class should regard
labor as "honest," though from the history of the word
such a collocation of terms as "honest labor" would once
have been as absurd as "honest villain."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>  A further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
influence effective in America has been the fluidity of class
distinctions in a new country. The "influence of the
frontier" has been all on the side of the value of work
and the reprobation of idleness. At least this is true for
men. A certain tendency has been manifest to exempt
women of the well-to-do classes from the necessity of labor,
and even by training and social pressure to exclude them
from the opportunity of work, and make of them a "leisure
class," but this is not likely to establish itself as a permanent
moral attitude. The woman will not be content
to live in "The Doll's House" while the man is in the
real work of the world.</p>

<p><b>3. The Distribution of the Goods of Life.</b>&mdash;Medi&aelig;val
society made provision for both benevolence and justice.
Charity, the highest of the virtues, had come to mean
specifically the giving of goods. The monasteries relieved
the poor and the infirm. Hospitals were established.
The gentleman felt it to be not only a religious duty, but
a tradition of his class to be liberal. To secure justice
in the distribution of wealth, various restrictions were
imposed. Goods were not to be sold for whatever they
could bring, nor was money to be loaned at whatever rate
of interest the borrower was willing to pay. Society
aimed to find out by some means what was a "reasonable
price" for products. In the case of manufactured goods
this could be fixed by the opinion of fellow craftsmen. A
"common estimation," where buyers and sellers met and
bargained in an open market, could be trusted to give a
fair value. A maximum limit was set for victuals in
towns. Or, again, custom prescribed what should be the
money equivalent for payments formerly made in kind,
or in personal service.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Money-lending was under especial
guard. To ask interest for the use of money, provided
the principal was returned intact, seemed to be taking
advantage of another's necessity. It was usury. Class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
morality added a different kind of restrictions. As embodied
in the laws, it bound the tenants to the soil and
forbade the migration of laborers. The significant thing
in the whole medi&aelig;val attitude was that <i>society attempted
to control business and industry by a moral standard</i>. It
did not trust the individual to make his own bargains or
to conduct his business as he pleased.</p>

<p><b>Modern Theory: Free Contract.</b>&mdash;The distinctive feature
of the modern development has been the tendency to
abandon moral restrictions and to substitute a wage
system, freedom of exchange, and free contract. It was
maintained by the advocates of the new method that it
was both more efficient and at least as just as the old.
It was more efficient because it stimulated every one to
make the best possible bargain. Surely every man is the
most interested, and therefore the best promoter of his
own welfare. And if each is getting the best results for
himself, the good of the whole community will be secured.
For&mdash;so ran the theory, when individualism had so far
advanced&mdash;society is simply the aggregate of its members;
the good of all is the sum of the goods of the
members. The system also claimed to provide for justice
between buyer and seller, capitalist and laborer, by the
agencies noticed in the next paragraph.</p>

<p><b>Competition.</b>&mdash;To prevent extortionate prices on the
one hand, or unduly low prices or wages on the other,
the reliance was on <i>competition</i> and the general principle
of supply and demand. If a baker charges too high for
his bread, others will set up shops and sell cheaper. If
a money-lender asks too high interest, men will not borrow
or will find a loan elsewhere. If a wage is too low, labor
will go elsewhere; if too high, capital will not be able
to find a profit and so will not employ labor&mdash;so runs
the theory. Without analyzing the moral value of the
theory at this point, we notice only that, so far as it
assumes to secure fair bargains and a just distribution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
it assumes the parties to the free contract to be really
free. This implies that they are upon nearly equal footing.
In the days of hand work and small industries this
was at least a plausible assumption. But a new face was
placed upon the situation by the <i>industrial revolution</i>.</p>

<p><b>Problem Raised by the Industrial Revolution.</b>&mdash;The
introduction of machinery on a large scale near the end
of the eighteenth century brought about a change which
has had extraordinary economic, social, and moral effects.
The revolution had two factors: (1) it used steam power
instead of human muscle; (2) it made possible the greater
subdivision of labor, and hence it made it profitable to
organize large bodies of men under a single direction. Both
these factors contributed to an enormous increase in productive
power. But this increase made an overwhelming
difference in the status of capitalist and laborer. Without
discussing the question as to whether capital received
more than a "fair" share of the increased profit, it was
obvious that if one "Captain of Industry" were receiving
even a small part of the profits earned by each of his
thousand workmen, he would be immeasurably better off
than any one of them. Like the mounted and armored
knight of the Middle Ages, or the baron in his castle, he
was more than a match for a multitude of poorly equipped
footmen. There seemed to be in the nineteenth century
an enormous disproportion between the shares of wealth
which fell to capitalist and to laborer. If this was the
result of "free contract," what further proof was necessary
that "freedom" was a mere empty term&mdash;a name with
no reality? For could it be supposed that a man would
<i>freely</i> make an agreement to work harder and longer than
any slave, receiving scarcely the bare necessities of existence,
while the other party was to gain enormous wealth
from the bargain?</p>

<p>The old class morality was not disturbed by such contrasts.
Even the religious morality was apt to consider
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>the distinction between rich and poor as divinely ordered,
or else as insignificant compared with eternal destiny of
weal or woe. But the individualistic movements have made
it less easy to accept either the class morality or the religious
interpretation. The latter lends itself equally well to
a justification of disease because it is providentially permitted.
Moreover, the old group morality and religious
ideal had this in their favor: they recognized an obligation
of the strong to the weak, of the group for every
member, of master for servant. The cash basis seemed to
banish all responsibility, and to assert the law of "each
for himself" as the supreme law of life&mdash;except so far as
individuals might mitigate suffering by voluntary kindness.
Economic theory seemed to show that wages must
always tend toward a starvation level.</p>

<p><b>Sympathy.</b>&mdash;Such tendencies inevitably called out response
from the sentiments of benevolence and sympathy.
For the spread of civilization has certainly made man more
sensitive to pain, more capable of sympathy and of entering
by imagination into the situations of others. It is
noteworthy that the same Adam Smith who argued so
forcibly the cause of individualism in trade, made sympathy
the basis of his moral system. Advance in sympathy
has shown itself in the abolition of judicial torture,
in prison reform, in the improved care of the insane and
defective; in the increased provision for hospitals, and
asylums, and in an innumerable multitude of organizations
for relief of all sorts and conditions of men. Missions,
aside from their distinctly ecclesiastical aims, represent
devotion of human life and of wealth to the relief
of sickness and wretchedness, and to the education of children
in all lands. Sympathy has even extended to the
animal world. And the notable fact in modern sympathy
and kindness, as contrasted with the medi&aelig;val type, is
that the growth in individuality has demanded and evoked
a higher kind of benevolence.  Instead of fostering de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>pendence
and relieving wants, the best modern agencies aim
to promote independence, to set the man upon his own
feet and enable him to achieve self-respect. "Social settlements"
have been strong factors in bringing about this
change of attitude.</p>

<p><b>Justice.</b>&mdash;Various movements looking toward greater
justice in distribution have likewise been called out by
the conditions since the industrial revolution. Naturally
one reaction was to denounce the whole individualistic
tendency as represented in the "cash-payment" basis. This
found its most eloquent expositor in Carlyle. His <i>Past
and Present</i> is a bitter indictment of a system "in which
all working horses could be well fed, and innumerable
workingmen should die starved"; of a <i>laissez-faire</i> theory
which merely says "impossible" when asked to remedy evils
supposedly due to "economic laws"; of a "Mammon Gospel"
which transforms life into a mutual hostility, with
its laws-of-war named "fair competition." The indictment
is convincing, but the remedy proposed&mdash;a return to strong
leaders with a re&euml;stablishment of personal relations&mdash;has
rallied few to its support. Another reaction against individualistic
selfishness has taken the form of communism.
Numerous experiments have been made by voluntary associations
to establish society on a moral basis by abolishing
private property. "These new associations," said Owen,
one of the most ardent and generous of social reformers,
"can scarcely be formed before it will be discovered that
by the most simple and easy regulations all the natural
wants of human nature may be abundantly supplied;
and the principle of selfishness will cease to exist for want
of an adequate motive to produce it."</p>

<p>In contrast with these plans for a return to earlier conditions,
the two most conspicuous tendencies in the thought
of the past century have claimed to be advancing toward
freedom and justice along the lines which we have just
traced. The one, which we may call "individualistic" re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>form,
has sought justice by giving free play to individual
action. The other, socialism, has aimed to use the power
of the State to secure more adequate justice and, as it
believes, a more genuine freedom. The great reform
movement in Great Britain during the nineteenth century
emphasized free trade and free contracts. It sought the
causes of injustice in the survival of some privilege or
vested interest which prevents the full working of the
principles of free contract and competition. Let every
man "count as one"; make laws for "the greatest good
of the greatest number." The trouble is not that there
is too much individualism, but that there is too little.
Tax reformers like Henry George have urged the same
principle. If land is monopolized by a few who can levy
a toll upon all the rest of society, how can justice obtain?
The remedy for injustice is to be found in promoting
greater freedom of industry and trade. Socialism on the
other hand claims that individualism defeats itself; it
results in tyranny, not freedom. The only way to secure
freedom is through united action. The merits of some
of these programs for social justice will be examined
in Part III. They signify that the age is finding its
moral problem set anew by the collision between material
interests and social good. Greek civilization used the industry
of the many to set free the higher life&mdash;art, government,
science&mdash;of a few. The medi&aelig;val ideal recognized
the moral value of industry in relation to character.
The modern conscience, resting back upon a higher appreciation
of human dignity and worth, is seeking to work
out a social and economic order that shall combine both
the Greek and the medi&aelig;val ideas. It will require work
and secure freedom. These are necessary for the individual
person. But it is beginning to be seen that these
values cannot be divided so that one social class shall perform
the labor and the other enjoy the freedom. The
growth of democracy means that all members of society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
should share in the value and the service of work. It
means that all should share according to capacity in the
values of free life, of intelligence and culture. Can material
goods be so produced and distributed as to promote
this democratic ideal?</p>


<h4>&sect; 6. THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF
INTELLIGENCE</h4>

<p>The development of intelligence in the modern world,
as in Greece, has two sides: on the one hand, a working-free
from the restrictions which theology or the State or
other social authorities imposed; on the other hand, positive
progress in knowledge of nature and of human life.
Under its first aspect it is known as the growth of rationalism;
under its second aspect, as the growth of science and
education. We cannot separate the development into two
periods, the one negative, the other positive, as was convenient
in the case of Greece. The negative and the positive
in the modern world have gone on contemporaneously,
although the emphasis has sometimes been on one side and
sometimes upon the other. We may, however, indicate
three periods as standing out with clearly defined characteristics.</p>

<p>(1) The Renaissance, in which the Greek spirit of
scientific inquiry found a new birth; in which the discovery
of new continents stimulated the imagination; and in
which new and more fruitful methods of investigation were
devised in mathematics and the natural sciences.</p>

<p>(2) The period of the Enlightenment, in which the
negative aspect of the process reached its sharpest definition.
The doctrines of revealed religion and natural religion
were criticised from the standpoint of reason. Mysteries
and superstition were alike rejected. General intelligence
made rapid progress. It was the "Age of Reason."</p>

<p>(3) The Nineteenth Century, in which both the natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and social sciences underwent an extraordinary development.
The doctrine of evolution has brought a new
point of view for considering the organic world and human
institutions. Education has come to be regarded as both
the necessary condition for the safety of society and as
the right of every human being; Science, in large measure
set free from the need of fighting for its right to exist,
is becoming constructive; it is assuming increasingly the
duty of preserving human life and health, of utilizing
and preserving natural resources, of directing political
and economic affairs.</p>

<p><b>1. The Renaissance.</b>&mdash;It would be giving a wrong impression
to imply that there was no inquiry, no use of
reason in the medi&aelig;val world. The problems set by the
inheritance of old-world religion and politics, forced themselves
upon the builders of castles and cathedrals,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> of law
and of dogma. As indicated above, the universities were
centers of discussion in which brilliant minds often challenged
received opinions. Men like Roger Bacon sought
to discover nature's secrets, and the great scholastics
mastered Greek philosophy in the interest of defending
the faith. But theological interest limited freedom and
choice of theme. It was not until the expansion of the
individual along the lines already traced&mdash;in political freedom,
in the use of the arts, in the development of commerce&mdash;that
the purely intellectual interest such as had
once characterized Greece awoke. A new world of possibilities
seemed dawning upon the Italian Galileo, the
Frenchman Descartes, the Englishman Francis Bacon.
The instruments of thought had been sharpened by the
dialectics of the schools; now let them be used to analyze
the world in which we live. Instead of merely observing
nature Galileo applied the experimental method, putting
definite questions to nature and thus preparing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
way for a progress step by step toward a positive knowledge
of nature's laws. Descartes found in mathematics
a method of analysis which had never been appreciated
before. What seemed the mysterious path of bodies in
curved lines could be given a simple statement in his analytic
geometry. Leibniz and Newton carried this method
to triumphant results in the analysis of forces. Reason
appeared able to discover and frame the laws of the universe&mdash;the
"principles" of nature. Bacon, with less of
positive contribution in method, sounded another note
which was equally significant. The human mind is liable
to be clouded and hindered in its activities by certain
inveterate sources of error. Like deceitful images or obsessions
the "idols" of the tribe, of the cave, of the
market, and of the theater&mdash;due to instinct or habit,
to language or tradition&mdash;prevent the reason from doing
its best work. It needs vigorous effort to free the mind
from these idols. But this can be done. Let man turn
from metaphysics and theology to nature and life; let him
follow reason instead of instinct or prejudice. "Knowledge
is power." Through it may rise above the kingdom
of nature the "kingdom of man." In his <i>New Atlantis</i>,
Bacon foresees a human society in which skill and invention
and government shall all contribute to human welfare.
These three notes, the experimental method, the power of
rational analysis through mathematics, and the possibility
of controlling nature in the interests of man, were
characteristic of the period.</p>

<p><b>2. The Enlightenment.</b>&mdash;A conflict of reason with authority
went on side by side with the progress of science.
Humanists and scientists had often set themselves against
dogma and tradition. The Reformation was not in form
an appeal to reason, but the clash of authorities stimulated
men to reasoning upon the respective claims of Catholic
and Protestant. And in the eighteenth century, under
the favoring influence of a broad toleration and a gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>eral
growth of intelligence, the conflict of reason with
dogma reached its culmination. The French call the
period "<i>l'Illumination</i>"&mdash;the illumination of life and experience
by the light of reason. The Germans call it the
<i>Aufkl&auml;rung</i>, "the clearing-up." What was to be cleared
up? First, ignorance, which limits the range of man's
power and infects him with fear of the unknown; then
superstition, which is ignorance consecrated by wont and
emotion; finally, dogma, which usually embodies irrational
elements and seeks to force them upon the mind by the
power of authority, not of truth. Nor was it merely a
question of intellectual criticism. Voltaire saw that dogma
was often responsible for cruelty. Ignorance meant belief
in witchcraft and magic. From the dawn of civilization
this had beset man's progress and quenched many of the
brightest geniuses of the past. It was time to put an
end once for all to the remnants of primitive credulity;
it was time to be guided by the light of reason. The
movement was not all negative. Using the same appeal
to "nature," which had served so well as a rallying cry
in the development of political rights, the protagonists of
the movement spoke of a "natural light" which God had
placed in man for his guidance&mdash;"the candle of the Lord
set up by himself in men's minds, which it is impossible
for the breath or power of man wholly to extinguish."
A natural and rational religion should take the place
of supposed revelation.</p>

<p>But the great achievement of the eighteenth century in
the intellectual development of the individual was that
the human mind came to realize the part it was itself
playing in the whole realm of science and conduct. Man
began to look within. Whether he called his work an
<i>Essay concerning Human Understanding</i>, or a <i>Treatise
of Human Nature</i>, or a <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>,
or a <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, the aim was
to study human experience. For of a sudden it was dawn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>ing
upon man that, if he was then living upon a higher
level of knowledge and conduct than the animal or the
savage, this must be due to the activity of the mind.
It appeared that man, not satisfied with "nature," had
gone on to build a new world with institutions and morality,
with art and science. This was no creation of
instinct or habit; nor could it be explained in terms of
sense, or feeling, or impulse alone; it was the work of
that more active, universal, and creative type of intelligence
which we call reason. Man, as capable of such
achievements in science and conduct, must be regarded
with new respect. As having political rights, freedom,
and responsibility, man has the dignity of a citizen,
sovereign as well as subject. As guiding and controlling
his own life and that of others by the power of ideas, not
of force, he has the dignity of a moral person, a moral
sovereignty. He does not merely take what nature brings;
he sets up ends of his own and gives them worth. In this,
Kant saw the supreme dignity of the human spirit.</p>

<p><b>3. The Present Significance and Task of Scientific
Method.</b>&mdash;In the thought that man is able to form ends
which have value for all, to set up standards which all
respect, and thus to achieve worth and dignity in the
estimation of his fellows, the Individualism of the eighteenth
century was already pointing beyond itself. For
this meant that the individual attains his highest reach
only as a member of a moral society. But it is one thing
to point out the need and meaning of a moral society, it is
another thing to bring such a society into being. It has
become evident during the past century that this is the
central problem for human reason to solve. The various
social sciences, economics, sociology, political science,
jurisprudence, social psychology, have either come into
being for the first time, or have been prosecuted with new
energy. Psychology has assumed new significance as
their instrument. Not that the scientific progress of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
century has seen its greatest triumphs in these fields. The
conspicuous successes have been rather in such sciences
as biology, or in the applications of science to engineering
and medicine. The social sciences have been occupied
largely in getting their problems stated and their methods
defined. But the discoveries and constructions of the
nineteenth century are none the less indispensable prerequisites
for a moral society. For the new conditions of
city life, the new sources of disease, the new dangers which
attend every successive step away from the life of the
savage, demand all the resources of the sciences.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> And as
the natural sciences overcome the technical difficulties
which obstruct their work of aiding human welfare, the
demand will be more insistent that the social sciences contribute
their share toward enabling man to fulfil his moral
life. Some of the specific demands will become more evident,
as we study in subsequent chapters the present
problems of political, economic, and family life.</p>

<p><b>Education.</b>&mdash;The importance for the moral life of the
modern development of science is paralleled by the significance
of modern education. The universities date from
the Middle Ages. The classical interest of humanism found
its medium in the college or "grammar school." The in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>vention
of printing and the growth of commerce promoted
elementary schools. Supposed necessities of popular government
stimulated a general educational movement in the
United States. Modern trade and industry have called
out the technical school. Germany has educated for
national defense and economic advance; England has concerned
itself pre&euml;minently for the education of statesmen
and administrators; and the United States for the education
of voters. But, whatever the motive, education
has been made so general as to constitute a new element
in the modern consciousness and a new factor to be reckoned
with. The moral right of every child to have an
education, measured not by his parents' abilities, but by
his own capacity, is gaining recognition. The moral value
of a possession, which is not, like material goods, exclusive,
but common, will be more appreciated when we
have worked out a more social and democratic type of
training.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><b>Theoretical Interpretation of this Period in Ethical
Systems.</b>&mdash;While the theoretical interpretation of this
period is to be treated in Part II., we may point out here
that the main lines of development which we have traced
find expression in the two systems which have been most
influential during the past century. These are the systems
of Kant and of the Utilitarians. The political and
certain aspects of the intellectual development are reflected
in the system of Kant. He emphasized freedom, the power
and authority of reason, human dignity, the supreme value
of character, and the significance of a society in which
every member is at once sovereign and subject. The Utilitarians
represent the values brought out in the development
of industry, education, and the arts. They claimed that
the good is happiness, and happiness of the greatest number.
The demands for individual satisfaction and for
social distribution of goods are voiced in this system.</p>

<br /><br />

A GENERAL COMPARISON OF CUSTOMARY AND
REFLECTIVE MORALITY</h2>


<p>To eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil may result in ultimate gain. A more
conscious and individualistic attitude may result in definite
conceptions of duty and rights, of values and ideals. At
the same time, as humanity's eyes have been opened and its
wisdom increased, many forms of nakedness unknown in
ruder conditions have been disclosed. With every increase
of opportunity and efficiency for good there is a
corresponding opportunity for evil. An immensely more
complex environment gives scope for correspondingly more
capable and subtle personalities. Some will react to the
situation in such a way as to rise to a higher moral level,
both in personal integrity and in public usefulness. Others
will find in facilities for gratifying some appetite or
passion a temptation too strong for their control and
will become vicious, or will seize the chances to exploit
others and become unjust in their acquirement and use of
power and wealth. There will be a Nero as well as an
Aurelius, a C&aelig;sar Borgia as well as a Savonarola, a
Jeffreys as well as a Sidney, a Bentham, or a Howard.
For an Eliot or a Livingston or an Armstrong, there are
the exploiters of lower races; and for an Elizabeth Fry,
the women who trade in the wretchedness of their kind.
By the side of those who use great abilities and resources
unselfishly are those who view indifferently the sacrifice
of human health or life, and pay no heed to human misery.
Such contrasts show that the "evolution of morality" is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
also an evolution of weakness, wretchedness, evil, and crime.
They suggest some general comparisons between custom
and reflective morality. They require from every age a
renewed analysis of conduct and the social system. As a
preliminary to such an analysis, we review in this chapter
some of the general relations between the morality of custom
and the morality of reflection.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. ELEMENTS OF AGREEMENT AND CONTINUITY</h4>

<p>The moral life shows its continuity in two ways. First,
the earlier type of group and customary morality persists
in part; in the second place, when the moral is differentiated
from the other spheres of life in which it was embedded,
it does not have to find entirely new conceptions.
It borrows its terms from the group life or from the various
spheres, religious, political, &aelig;sthetic, economic, which
separate out from the older group unity.</p>

<p>The following quotation from Grote will serve as a vivid
restatement of the r&eacute;gime of custom:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This aggregate of beliefs and predispositions to believe,
Ethical, Religious, &AElig;sthetical, and Social, respecting what is
true or false, probable or improbable, just or unjust, holy
or unholy, honorable or base, respectable or contemptible,
pure or impure, beautiful or ugly, decent or indecent, obligatory
to do or obligatory to avoid, respecting the status and
relations of each individual in the society, respecting even the
admissible fashions of amusement and recreation&mdash;this is an
established fact and condition of things, the real origin of
which is for the most part unknown, but which each new
member of the group is born to and finds subsisting.... It
becomes a part of each person's nature, a standing habit of
mind, or fixed set of mental tendencies, according to which
particular experience is interpreted and particular persons
appreciated.... The community hate, despise or deride any
individual member who proclaims his dissent from their social
creed.... Their hatred manifests itself in different ways
... at the very least by exclusion from that amount of forbearance,
good will and estimation without which the life of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
an individual becomes insupportable.... 'Nomos (Law and
Custom), king of all' (to borrow the phrase which Herodotus
cites from Pindar) exercises plenary power, spiritual and
temporal, over individual minds; moulding the emotions as
well as the intellect, according to the local type ... and
reigning under the appearance of habitual, self-suggested
tendencies."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p></div>

<p>The important facts brought out are (1) the existence
in a social group of certain habits not only of acting, but
of feeling and believing about actions, of valuing or approving
and disapproving. (2) The persistent forcing
of these mental habitudes upon the attention of each new
member of the group. The newcomer, whether by birth
or adoption, is introduced into a social medium whose
conditions and regulations he can no more escape than
he can those of his physical environment. (3) Thus the
mental and practical habits of the newly introduced individual
are shaped. The current ways of esteeming and
behaving in the community become a "standing habit" of
his own mind; they finally reign as "habitual, self-suggested
tendencies." Thus he becomes a full member of the social
group, interested in the social fabric to which he belongs,
and ready to do his part in maintaining it.</p>

<p><b>1. Persistence of Group Morality.</b>&mdash;Comparing this
state of affairs with what obtains to-day in civilized communities,
we find certain obvious points of agreement. The
social groups with which an individual comes in touch are
now more numerous and more loosely formed. But everywhere
there are customs not only of acting, but of thinking
and feeling about acting. Each profession, each institution,
has a <i>code</i> of which the individual has to take account.
The nature of this code, unexpressed as well as
formulated, is brought to the attention of the individual
in countless ways; by the approval and disapproval of its
public opinion; by his own failures and successes; by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
own tendency to imitate what he sees about him, as well as
by deliberate, intentional instruction.</p>

<p>In other words, group morality does not vanish in order
that conscious and personal morality may take its place.
Group and customary morality is still the morality of many
of us most of the time, and of all of us for a good deal
of the time. We do not any of us think out all of our
standards, weigh independently our values, make all our
choices in a rational manner, or form our characters by
following a clearly conceived purpose. As children we
all start in a family group. We continue in a school
group and perhaps a church group. We enter an occupation
group, and later, it may be, family, political, social,
and neighborhood groups. In every one of these if we are
members, we must to a certain degree accept standards
that are given. We have to play according to the rules
of the game. As children we do this unconsciously. We
imitate, or follow suggestions; we are made to conform
by all the agencies of group morality&mdash;group opinion,
ritual, pleasure and pain, and even by taboos;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> above all,
we act as the others act, and co&ouml;perate more or less to
a common end. We form habits which persist, many of
them as long as we live. We accept many of the traditions
without challenge. Even when we pass from the
early family group to the new situations and surroundings
which make us repeat more or less of the experience
of the race, a large share of our conduct and of our
judgments of others is determined by the influences of
group and custom. And it is fortunate for progress that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
this is true. If every one had to start anew to frame
all his ideals and make his laws, we should be in as melancholy
a plight morally as we should be intellectually if
we had to build each science anew. The fundamental safeguards
which the group provides against individual impulse
and passion, the condition of close association, interdependence
and mutual sympathy which the group affords,
the habituation to certain lines of conduct valued by the
group&mdash;all this is a root on which the stem and flower of
personal morality may grow. Individualism and intellectual
activity, however necessary to man's progress, would
give no morality did they not start out of this deeper
level of common feeling and common destiny. The rational
and personal agencies of the "third level" come not
to destroy, but to fulfill the meaning of the forces and
agencies of the first and second levels described in Chapters
III and IV.</p>

<p><b>2. The Moral Conceptions.</b>&mdash;The conceptions for the
moral are nearly all taken from the group relations or
from the jural and religious aspects, as these have been
gradually brought to clearer consciousness. As already
noted, the Greek term "ethical," the Latin "moral," the
German "<i>sittlich</i>," suggest this&mdash;<i>ethos</i> meant the "sum of
the characteristic usages, ideas, standards, and codes by
which a group was differentiated and individualized in
character from other groups."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Some specific moral terms come directly from group
relations. The "kind" man acts as one of the kin. When
the ruling or privileged group is contrasted with the man
of no family or of inferior birth, we get a large number
of terms implying "superiority" or "inferiority" in birth,
and so of general value. This may or may not be due
to some inherent superiority of the upper class, but it
means at least that the upper class has been most effectual
in shaping language and standards of approval. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
"noble" and "gentle" referred to birth before they had
moral value; "duty" in modern usage seems to have been
principally what was due to a superior. Many words for
moral disapproval are very significant of class feeling.
The "caitiff" was a captive, and the Italians have their
general term for morally bad, "<i>cattivo</i>," from the same
idea. The "villain" was a feudal tenant, the "blackguard"
looked after the kettles, the "rascal" was one of
the common herd, the "knave" was the servant; the "base"
and "mean" were opposed to the gentle and noble. Another
set of conceptions reflects the old group <i>approvals</i>
or combines these with conceptions of birth. We have
noted the twofold root of <i>kalokagathia</i> in Greek. "Honor"
and "honesty" were what the group admired, and conversely
"<i>aischros</i>" and "<i>turpe</i>" in Greek and Latin, like
the English "disgraceful" or "shameful," were what the
group condemned. "Virtue" was the manly excellence
which called out the praise of a warlike time, while one
of the Greek terms for morally bad originally meant
cowardly, and our "scoundrel" has possibly the same
origin. The "bad" was probably the weak or the womanish.
The economic appears in "merit," what I have earned,
and likewise in "duty" and "ought," what is due or owed&mdash;though
duty seems to have made itself felt especially, as
noted above, toward a superior. Forethought and skill
in practical affairs provided the conception of "wisdom,"
which was highest of the virtues for the Greeks, and as
"prudence" stood high in medi&aelig;val systems. The conception
of valuing and thus of forming some permanent
standard of a better and a worse, is also aided, if not
created, by economic exchange. It appears in almost
identical terms in Plato and the New Testament in the
challenge, "What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole
world and lose his own life?"<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> From the processes of fine
or useful arts came probably the conceptions of measure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
order, and harmony. A whole mode of considering the
moral life is jural. "Moral law," "authority," "obligation,"
"responsibility," "justice," "righteousness," bring
with them the associations of group control and of the more
definitely organized government and law. Finally the last
named terms bear also a religious imprint, and numerous
conceptions of the moral come from that sphere or get their
specific flavor from religious usage. The conceptions of the
"soul" have contributed to the ideal of a good which is permanent,
and which is made rather by personal companionship,
than by sensuous gratification. "Purity" began
as a magical and religious idea; it came to symbolize
not only freedom from contamination but singleness of
purpose. "Chastity" lends a religious sacredness to a
virtue which had its roots largely in the conception of
property. "Wicked" is from witch.</p>

<p>We have indeed certain conceptions drawn from individual
experiences of instinct, or reflection. From the sense
recoil from what was disgusting such conceptions as "foul,"
and from kindred imagery of what suits eye or muscular
sense come "straightforward," "upright," "steady."
From the thinking process itself we have "conscience."
This word in Greek and Latin was a general term for
consciousness and suggests one of the distinctive, perhaps
the most distinctive characteristic of the moral. For it
implies a "conscious" thoughtful attitude, which operates
not only in forming purposes, but in measuring and valuing
action by the standards it approves. But it is evident
that by far the larger part of our ethical terms are derived
from social relations in the broad sense.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. ELEMENTS OF CONTRAST</h4>

<p><b>Differentiation of the Moral.</b>&mdash;The most obvious difference
between the present and the early attitude is that
we now make a clear distinction between the moral aspect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of behavior and other aspects such as the conventional,
the political, the legal; while in customary morality all activities
esteemed by society were put upon the same level and
enforced with the same vigor. Matters which we should
regard as purely matters of fashion or etiquette, or as
modes of amusement, such as styles of wearing the hair,
were imperative. To mutilate the body in a certain way
was as exigent as to observe certain marriage customs;
to refrain from speaking to the mother-in-law as
binding as to obey the chieftain; not to step over the
shadow of the chief was even more important than not to
murder the member of another tribe. In general we make
a clear distinction between "manners" and morals, while
in customary morality manners <i>are</i> morals, as the very
words "ethical," "moral" still testify.</p>

<p>When Grote speaks of "Ethical, Religious, &AElig;sthetical,
and Social" beliefs, the term "ethical" belongs with the
other terms only from a modern standpoint. The characteristic
thing about the condition of which he is speaking
is that the "religious, &aelig;sthetical, and social" beliefs
brought to bear upon the individual <i>constitute</i> the ethical.
We make the distinction between them as naturally
as the r&eacute;gime of custom failed to make it. Only by imagining
a social set in which failure to observe punctiliously
the fashions of the set as to the proper style of dress
makes the person subject to a disparagement which influences
his feelings and ideas as keenly <i>and in the same
way</i> as conviction of moral delinquency, can we realize
the frame of mind characteristic of the ethics of
custom.</p>

<p><b>Observing versus Reflecting.</b>&mdash;Customs may be "observed."
Indeed, customary morality made goodness or
rightness of character practically identical with observing
the established order of social estimations in all departments.
This word <i>observe</i> is significant: it means to note,
or notice as matter of fact, by perception; and it means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
to yield allegiance, to conform to, in action.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The element
of intelligence, of reason, is thus reduced to a minimum.
The moral values are <i>there</i>, so to speak, palpably, tangibly;
and the individual has only to use his mind enough
to notice them. And since they are forced upon his notice
by drastic and unrelaxing methods of discipline, little initiative
is required for even the attitude of attention. But
when the moral is something which is in customs and
habits, rather than those customs themselves, the good and
right do not stand out in so obvious and external fashion.
Recognition now demands thought, reflection; the power of
abstraction and generalization. A child may be shown in
a pretty direct and physical fashion the difference between
<i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> in its bearing upon his conduct:
a fence may be pointed at which divides his yard from that
of a neighbor and which draws as well the moral line between
what is permissible and what is forbidden; a whipping
may intensify the observation. But modern business
knows also of "intangible" property&mdash;good will, reputation,
credit. These, indeed, can be bought and sold but
the detection of their existence and nature demands an intelligence
which is more than perception. The greater
number of duties and rights of which present morality
consists are of just this type. They are relations, not just
outward habits. Their acknowledgment requires accordingly
something more than just to follow and reproduce
existing customs. It involves power to see <i>why</i> certain
habits are to be followed, what <i>makes</i> a thing good or bad.
<i>Conscience</i> is thus substituted for <i>custom</i>; <i>principles</i> take
the place of external <i>rules</i>.</p>

<p>This is what we mean by calling present morality reflective
rather than customary. It is not that social customs
have ceased to be, or even have been reduced in number.
The exact contrary is the case. It is not that they have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
shrunk in importance, or that they have less significance
for the individual's activity, or claim less of his attention.
Again, the reverse is the case. But the individual has to
grasp the <i>meaning</i> of these customs over and above the
bare fact of their existence, and has to guide himself by
their <i>meaning</i> and not by the mere fact noted.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><b>Custom is Static.</b>&mdash;This difference introduces a second
very important difference. In customary morality, there
is no choice between being enmeshed in the net of social
rules which control activity, and being an outlaw&mdash;one beyond
the pale, whose hand is against every man's, and
every man's against him. The extent to which social customs
are regarded as of divine origin and are placed under
the protection of the gods, i.e., the tendency of all sanctions
to become religious and supernatural, is evidence of
the binding force of institutions upon the individual. To
violate them is impiety, sacrilege, and calls down the wrath
of gods, as well as of men. The custom cannot be questioned.
To inquire means uncertainty, and hence it is immoral,
an attack upon the very foundations of the life of
the group. The apparent exception, which after all exhibits
the rule, is the case of great reforming heroes who
demarcate epochs of history even in customary societies.
Such individuals meet contemporary opposition and persecution;
it is only by victory, by signal success over a
rival faction at home, over plague and famine, or over an
enemy abroad, that the hero is justified. Thereby it is
proved that the gods are with him and sanction his
changes&mdash;indeed that he is their own chosen instrument.
Then the modified or new customs and institutions have
all the binding sacredness and supernatural sanction of
the old. It is not yet an outgrown story for the fathers
to kill the prophets, and for the sons to build and adorn
their tombs, and make them into shrines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Reflection Discovers a Higher Law.</b>&mdash;But in so far
as the individual's activity is directed by his comprehension
of the <i>meaning</i> of customs, not by his apprehension of
their <i>existence</i>, so far the notion of moral progress or reform
in social affairs becomes ethically important and
greater moral responsibility is put upon the individual
just as greater practical freedom is secured to him. For
(a) the individual may set the meaning of a custom <i>against</i>
its present form; or (b) he may find the meaning of
some custom much more commanding in value than that of
others, and yet find that its realization is hindered by the
existence of these other customs of less moral importance.
On the basis of such discrimination, the abolition or, at
least, the modification of certain social habits is demanded.
So far as this sort of situation frequently recurs, the individual
(c) becomes more or less vaguely aware that he
<i>must not accept the current standard</i> as justification of
his own conduct, unless <i>it also</i> justify itself to his own
moral intelligence. The fact that it exists gives it indeed
a certain <i>prima facie</i> claim, but no ultimate moral warrant.
Perhaps the custom is itself wrong&mdash;and the individual
is responsible for bearing this possibility in mind.</p>

<p><b>Consequent Transformation of Custom.</b>&mdash;Of course
the plane of customary morality still persists; no wholesale
divergence of reflective from customary morality exists.
Practically, for example, many business men do not
bother themselves about the morality of certain ways of doing
business. Such and such is the custom of the trade, and
if a man is going to do business at all he must follow its
customs&mdash;or get out. Law, medicine, the ministry, journalism,
family life, present, in considerable extent, the same
phenomenon. Customary morality persists, almost as the
core of present morality. But there is still a difference.
A few, at least, are actively engaged in a moral criticism
of the custom, in a demand for its transformation; and almost
everybody is sufficiently affected by the discussions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and agitations thus called out to have some lingering and
uneasy idea of responsibility for his part in the maintenance
of a questionable custom. The duty of some exercise
of discriminating intelligence as to existing customs
for the sake of improvement and progress, is thus a mark
of reflective morality&mdash;of the r&eacute;gime of conscience as over
against custom. In the morally more advanced members
of contemporary society, the need of fostering a habit of
examination and judgment, of keeping the mind open,
sensitive, to the defects and the excellences of the existing
social order is recognized as obligation. To reflect
on one's own behavior in relation to the existing order is a
standing habit of mind.</p>

<p><b>Deepening of Meaning.</b>&mdash;While the materials and conceptions
of more conscious morality are provided by the
earlier stages, and taken from other spheres of life,
we find that these conceptions naturally undergo a deepening
of meaning when they are used to express the more
intimate and personal attitude. Take, for example, the
conceptions borrowed from the jural sphere. It is in
the school of government and courts that man has learned
to talk and think of right and law, of responsibility and
justice. To make these moral instead of jural terms,
the first thing that is needed is that we make the whole
process an inward one. The person must himself set
up a standard, recognize it as "law," judge his conduct
by it, hold himself responsible to himself, and seek to do
justice. It takes several persons to carry on these processes
in the realm of government. Legislators, judges,
jury, executive officers, all represent the State, organized
society. That a single person can be himself lawgiver,
judge, and jury, as well as claimant or defendant, shows
that he is himself a complex being. He is a being
of passions, appetites, and individual interests, but he
is also a being who has a rational and social nature.
As a member of society he not only feels his individual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
interest but recognizes social interests. As a rational
being he not only feels the thrill of passion but responds
to the authority of a law and obeys the voice of duty.
Like a member of a democratic State he finds himself in
the sphere of conduct, not only a subject but a sovereign,
and feels the dignity of a <i>person</i>. A conscientious person
is in so far one who has made the law of God or man
an inward law of life&mdash;a "moral law." But the act of
making the process inward makes possible a deepening
of meaning. Governments and courts are necessarily
limited in purview and fallible in decisions. They are sometimes
too lenient, sometimes too severe. Conscience implies
a knowledge of the whole act&mdash;purpose, motive, and deed.
Its authority makes claim for absolute obedience. The
laws of the State are felt to be binding just because they
are believed to be, on the whole, right and just as measured
by this moral court of appeal. When they conflict, the
power may be with the political sovereign, but the man
whose conscience is clear believes that he follows a "higher
law." Much of the great literature of the world draws
its interest from its portrayal of this fundamental fact
of human experience. "Two things fill the mind with
ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener
and the more steadily we reflect on them: the starry
heavens above and the moral law within."</p>

<p>The conceptions taken from the economic sphere show
similar deepening. In the economic world things are
good or have value if people want them. It is in the
experience of satisfying wants that man has learned the
language of "good and evil," and to compare one good
with another; it is doubtless by the progress of science
and the arts that objective standards of more permanent,
rational, and social "goods" are provided. When this
term is taken up to a higher level and given moral meaning,
two new factors appear. First the individual begins
to consider his various goods and values in relation to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
each other and to his life as a whole. In the second
place, in thus comparing the various goods and the desires
they satisfy, he begins to realize that in some way
he is himself more than the mere sum of his natural
instincts and appetites. He finds that he can take an
interest in certain things, and is not merely passive. He
<i>gives</i> value as well as measures it. He feels that as such
an active and organizing judge and creator of value, he
himself has a higher worth than any of the particular
things that gratify particular desires. "A man's life
consisteth not in the abundance of the things that he possesseth."
"The life is more than meat." Or, to use the
phrase which will be explained later, moral good implies
purpose, character, "good will." In common language, it
implies being, and not merely having.</p>

<p>The term good where used in our judgments upon others
(as in a "good" man), may have a different history.
As has been noted, it may come from class feeling, or
from the praise we give to acts as they immediately please.
It may be akin to noble or fine or admirable. All such
conceptions undergo a similar transformation as they
pass from the sphere of class or public opinion to become
moral terms. As moral they imply in the first place that
we consider not merely outward acts, but inward purpose
and character. They imply in the second place that we
who judge are ourselves acting not as members of a
class, not as merely emotional beings, but as social and
rational. Our moral judgments in this sense are from
a general, a universal standard; those of a class are
partial.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. OPPOSITION BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL AIMS
AND STANDARDS</h4>

<p><b>Withdrawal from the Social Order.</b>&mdash;The development
of reflection tends to set up a moral opposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
between the individual and society. Sometimes "conscience"
goes beyond the need of criticizing, of discriminating,
of interpreting social customs, of following their
spirit rather than their letter; it takes the form of an
assertion of a purely inner, personal morality, so distinct
from the conditions of social life that the latter are
conceived to be totally lacking in positive moral significance.
The prescriptions of morality are thought to be
revealed in conscience, as a faculty of pure intuition or
revelation, receiving neither material nor warrant from
social conditions. The distinction already spoken of between
the moral and the economic, legal, or conventional,
is conceived as a complete separation; customs and
institutions are external, indifferent, irrelevant, or even
hostile to the ideal and personally perceived demands of
morality. Such a conception of morality is especially
likely to arise in a period when through the clash of ways
and standards of living, all customs, except those maintained
by force and authority, are disintegrating or
relaxing. Such a state existed in the early years of the
Roman empire when, for the first time in history, local
boundaries were systematically overstepped; when the
empire was a seething mixture of alien and unlike gods,
beliefs, ideals, standards, practices. In the almost universal
flux and confusion, <i>external</i> order was maintained
by the crystallized legislation and administration of Rome;
but personal aims and modes of behavior had to be ascertained
by the individual thrown back upon himself.
Christian, Stoic, Epicurean, alike found the political order
wholly external to the moral, or in chronic opposition to
it. There was a withdrawal into the region of personal
consciousness. In some cases the withdrawal was pushed
to the point where men felt that they could be truly
righteous only by going by themselves into the desert, to
live as hermits; or by forming separate communities of
those who agreed in their conceptions of life; mental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
and moral aloofness from prevailing social standards and
habitudes was preached by all.</p>

<p><b>Individual Emancipation.</b>&mdash;In other cases, what takes
place is a consciousness of liberation; of assertion of
personal rights and privileges, claims for new modes of
activity and new kinds of enjoyment. The individual
feels that he is his own end; that the impulses and capacities
which he finds in himself are sacred, and afford the
only genuine law for his behavior; that whatever restricts
the full exercise of these personal powers and hampers the
satisfaction of personal desires is coercive and morally abnormal.
Existing social institutions may be practically
necessary, but they are morally undesirable; they are to
be used, or got around in the interests of personal gratifications.
As some feel that social conditions are hostile
to the realization of the highest moral <i>obligations</i>, so
others feel that they are hostile to the full possession of
their <i>rights</i>, of that to which they are properly entitled.</p>

<p><b>Eventual Transformation of Social Values and Aims.</b>&mdash;In
extreme cases, the individual may come to believe
that, either on the basis of his true obligations or his
true rights, the very principle of society is morally indifferent
or even unworthy; that the moral life is eventually
or intrinsically an individual matter, although it happens
to be outwardly led under social conditions. But in the
main the opposition is not to the social relations as such,
but to existing institutions and customs as inadequate.
Then the reaction of the individual against the existing
social scheme, whether on the ground of ideals too high
to be supported by it or on the ground of personal claims
to which it does not afford free play, becomes a means
to the reconstruction and transformation of social habits.
In this way, <i>reflective morality is a mark of a progressive
society, just as customary morality is of a stationary
society</i>. Reflection on values is the method of their
modification.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>The monastic Christian in his outward withdrawal
from social life, still maintained the conception of a perfected
society, of a kingdom of God or Heaven to be
established. This ideal became to some extent the working
method for changing the existing order. The Stoics,
who held in light esteem existing community ties, had the
conception of a universal community, a cosmopolis, ruled
by universal law, of which every rational being was a
member and subject. This notion became operative to
some extent in the development of judicial and administrative
systems much more generalized and equitable than
the purely local customs, laws, and standards which it
swept away. The Epicurean had the ideal of friendship
on the basis of which were formed groups of congenial
associates held together neither by legal ties, nor by universal
laws of reason, nor by unity of religious aspiration
and belief, but by friendship and companionable intercourse.
Thus were afforded other centers of social
reconstruction.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4. EFFECTS UPON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER</h4>

<p><b>General Effects.</b>&mdash;The characteristic differences which
have been pointed out in the preceding section, when taken
together with the specific conditions of change&mdash;liberty
of action and thought, incentives to private acquisition,
facilities for power and pleasure&mdash;enable us to understand
the contrasts referred to at the opening of the
chapter. We have, on the one hand, the inbred craving
for power, for acquisition, for excitement, for gratification
of sense and appetite, enhanced by what it feeds on. We
have, on the other hand, the progressive differentiation
of the moral, tearing the individual loose from the bonds
of the external moral order and forcing him to stand
on his own feet&mdash;or fall. Note how each of the points
brought out in the preceding section operates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>(1) To separate out the moral as a distinct element
from certain spheres of life, allows the less seriously
minded and the less sympathetic individuals to live complacently
a trivial or unscrupulous life. Fashion, "social
duties," amusements, "culture" emptied of all earnest
meaning, "business" and "politics" divorced from any
humane or public considerations, may be regarded as justifiable
vocations. A "gentleman" who no longer has the
occupation of his fighting predecessors as an excuse for
a distinct type of life, may find the support of a large
leisure class in declining any useful service to the community
and devoting himself to "sport"; a "lady" may
be so engaged by the multifarious demands of "society"
as never to notice what an utterly worthless round she
follows.</p>

<p>(2) The fact that the morality of conscience requires
reflection, progress, and a deeper meaning for its conception,
makes it obvious why many fail to grasp any
moral meaning at all. They fail to put forth the effort,
or to break with habit. Under customary morality
it was enough to "observe" and to continue in the mores.
It requires a higher degree of insight and a greater
initiative to get any moral attitude at all when the forms
have become mere forms and the habits mere habits.
Hence when a change in personal environment or in
general social and economic conditions comes, many fail
to see the principles involved. They remain completely
satisfied with the "old-fashioned virtues" or intrench
themselves in the "righteousness" and "honesty" of a
past generation. This habitual and "painless" morality
will often mean a "virtue" or "righteousness" which involves
no conflict with present conditions. A man who
feels honest because he does not break contracts or defraud
in old-fashioned ways, may be quite at ease about
watering stock or adulterating goods. A society which
abhors murder with iron and explosives in the form of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
daggers and bombs, may feel quite unconcerned about the
preventable homicides by iron machinery, or by explosives
used in coal mines.</p>

<p>(3) The conflict with society which reflective morality
requires, works to thrust some below the general level,
while it raises others above it. To criticize the general
moral order may make a man a prophet, but it may also
make him a Pharisee. Practical reaction may make
reformers, but it is likely to make another set of
men dissolute; to make them feel superior to the morality
of "Philistines" and therefore exempt from social
restraints.</p>

<p><b>Vices Incident to Reflective Stage.</b>&mdash;The vices increase
with civilization, partly because of increased opportunity,
partly because of increased looseness in social restraint.
There is a further element. When any activity of man
is cut off from its original and natural relations and
made the object of special attention and pursuit, the
whole adjustment is thrown out of balance. What was
before a useful function becomes pathological. The
craving for excitement or stimulation is normal within
certain limits. In the chase or the battle, in the venture
of the explorer or the merchant, it functions as a healthy
incentive. When isolated as an end in itself, taken out
of the objective social situation, it becomes the spring
of gambling or drunkenness. The instincts and emotions
of sex, possessing power and interest necessitated by their
place in the continuance of the race, become when isolated
the spring of passion or of obscenity or lubricity. Avarice
and gluttony illustrate the same law. The gladiatorial
shows at Rome became base and cowardly when the
Romans were themselves no longer fighters.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Even the
aspiration for what is higher and better may become an
"otherworldliness" which leaves this world to its misery
and evil. Such a series of pictures as Balzac has given in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
his <i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i>, shows better than any labored
description the possibilities of modern civilization.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, in civilized society a further most
demoralizing agency unknown to earlier life. As the vices
are specialized and pursued they become economic and
political interests. Vast capital is invested in the business
of ministering to the vicious appetites. It is pecuniarily
desirable that these appetites should be stimulated
as greatly as possible. It makes "business." The tribute
levied by public officials upon the illegal pursuits forms
a vast fund for carrying elections. The multitude engaged
in the traffic or dependent upon it for favors, can
be relied upon to cast their votes as a unit for men who
will guarantee protection.</p>

<p><b>Relations to Fellow Men.</b>&mdash;The motives and occasions
for selfishness and injustice have been indicated sufficiently
perhaps in preceding chapters. As the general
process of increasing individuality and reflection goes on,
it is an increasingly easy matter to be indifferent or
even unjust. When all lead a common life it is easy to
enter into the situation of another, to appreciate his
motives, his needs, and in general to "put yourself in his
place." The external nature of the conduct makes it
easy to hold all to a common standard. The game must
be shared; the property&mdash;so far as there is property&mdash;respected;
the religious rites observed. But when standards
becomes more inward the more intelligent or rigorous
may find sympathy less easy. When they attempt to be
"charitable" they may easily become condescending. The
pure will not soil their skirts by contact with the fallen.
The "high-minded citizen" refuses to mix in politics. The
scholar thinks the business man materialistic. The man
of breeding, wealth, and education finds the uneducated
laborer lacking in courtesy and refinement and argues
that it is useless to waste sympathy upon the "masses."
The class terms which have become moral terms are illus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>trations
of this attitude. Finally, the moral process
of building up freedom and right easily leads to a disposition
to stand on rights and let other persons look
out for themselves. Kant's doctrine, that since all morality
is personal I can do nothing to promote my neighbor's
perfection, is a <i>laissez faire</i> in ethics which he did not
carry out, but it is a not unnatural corollary of reflective
morality. "Am I my brother's keeper?" is much more
likely to be the language of reflective, than of customary
and group life.</p>

<p><b>Reconstructive Forces.</b>&mdash;We have dwelt at length upon
the disintegrating forces, not because civilization necessarily
grows worse, but because, having pointed out in
earlier chapters the positive advances, it becomes necessary
to allude also to the other aspect of the process. Otherwise
it might appear that there is no problem. If the
evolution were supposed to be all in one direction there
would be no seriousness in life. It is only in the pressure
of constantly new difficulties and evils that moral character
adds new fiber, and moral progress emerges. Individualism,
self-seeking, and desire for property force
the establishment of governments and courts which protect
poor as well as rich. Luxury and ostentation have
not only called out the asceticism which renounces the
world and sees in all gratification of appetite an evil;
they have brought into the fore the serious meaning of
life; they have served to emphasize the demand for social
justice. The countless voluntary associations for the
relief of sickness, misfortune, and poverty; for aiding
the defective, dependent, and criminal; for promoting numberless
good causes&mdash;enlist a multitude in friendly co-operation.
The rising demand for legislation to embody
the new sentiments of justice is part of the process of
reconstruction. And now when all the arts and goods of
civilization are becoming more and more fully the work, not
of any individual's labor or skill, but rather of the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>bined
labor and intelligence of many, when life in cities is
necessitating greater interdependence, finally when contrasts
in conditions are brought more forcibly to notice by
the very progress of knowledge and the means of knowledge,&mdash;the
more thoroughly social use of all that civilization
produces becomes more insistent and compelling. It
is not a matter of sentiment but of necessity. If any one
is disposed to deny the claim, it becomes increasingly certain
that Carlyle's Irish widow will prove her sisterhood by
infecting the denier with fever;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> that the ignorant, or
criminal, or miserable will jeopardize his happiness.</p>


<h4>&sect; 5. MORAL DIFFERENTIATION AND THE SOCIAL ORDER</h4>

<p>Two processes went on side by side in the movement we
have traced. (1) The primitive group, which was at once
a kinship or family, an economic, a political, a religious,
an educational, and a moral unit, was broken down and
replaced by several distinct institutions, each with its
own special character. (2) The moral, which was so
largely unreflective that it could be embodied in every
custom and observance, became more personal and subjective.
The result of this was either that the moral
was now more consciously and voluntarily <i>put into</i> the
social relations, thereby raising them all to a higher moral
level, or that, failing such a leavening of the distinct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
spheres of the social order, the latter were emptied of moral
value and lost moral restraints. We notice very briefly
certain illustrations of this, leaving a fuller treatment
for Part III.</p>

<p><b>The Family.</b>&mdash;When the family was largely determined
by status, when it was an economic, a political, and
a religious unit, it had a strong support. But the support
was largely external to the true purpose and meaning
of the family. Only as these other elements were
separated, and the family placed on a voluntary basis,
could its true significance emerge. Affection and mutual
supplementation of husband and wife, love and devotion
to offspring, must stand the strains formerly distributed
over several ties. The best types of family life which
have resulted from this more moral basis are unquestionably
far superior to the older form. At the same time
the difficulties and perversion or subversion of the more
voluntary type are manifest. When no personal attachment
was sought or professed, or when marriage by
purchase was the approved custom, the marriage contracted
under these conditions might have all the value
which the general state of intelligence and civilization allowed.
When the essential feature which hallows the
union has come to be recognized as a union of will and
affection, then marriage without these, however "solemnized,"
almost inevitably means moral degradation. And
if the consent of the parties is regarded as the basis
of the tie, then it is difficult to make sure that this
"consent" has within it enough of steadfast, well-considered
purpose and of emotional depth to take the place
of all the older sanctions and to secure permanent unions.
The more complete responsibility for the children which
has been gained by the separation of the family, has also
proved susceptible of abuse as well as of service. For
while savages have often practiced infanticide for economic
reasons, it is doubtful if any savage family ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
equaled the more refined selfishness and cruelty of the
child labor which modern families have furnished and
modern society has permitted.</p>

<p><b>The Economic and Industrial.</b>&mdash;The economic lost powerful
restraints when it became a separate activity
divorced from family, religious, and, in the view of some,
from moral considerations. It has worked out certain important
moral necessities of its own. Honesty, the keeping
of contracts, the steadiness and continuity of character
fostered by economic relations, are important
contributions. Modern business, for example, is the most
effective agency in securing sobriety. It is far more
efficient than "temperance societies." Other values of the
economic and industrial process&mdash;the increase of production,
the interchange of services and goods, the new means
of happiness afforded by the increase of wealth&mdash;are
obvious. On the other hand, the honesty required by
business is a most technical and peculiarly limited sort.
It does not interfere with adulteration of goods under
certain conditions, nor with corrupt bargains with public
officials. The measurement of values on a purely pecuniary
basis tends to release a large sphere of activity from any
moral restraints. The maxim "Business is business" may
be made the sanction for any kind of conduct not excluded
by commercial standards. Unless there is a constant injection
of moral valuation and control, there is a tendency
to subvert all other ends and standards to the purely
economic.</p>

<p><b>Law and Government.</b>&mdash;To remove these functions
from the kinship group as such, is at once to bring the
important principles of authority and duty, and gradually
of rights and freedom, to consciousness. Only by
such separation could the universality and impartiality
of law be established. And only by universality can the
judgment of the society as a whole be guaranteed its
execution as over against the variations in intelligence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and right purpose of individual rulers and judges. Moreover,
the separation of law from morality has likewise
its gain or loss. On the one hand, to separate off a definite
sphere of external acts to which alone physical constraints
or penalties may attach, is at once to free a
great sphere of inner thought and purpose and to enable
purely psychical values and restraints to attain far
greater power in conduct. Liberty of thought and religious
belief, sincerity and thorough responsibility, require
such a separation. It is also to make possible a
general law which rises above the conscience of the lower
even if it does not always reach the level of the most
enlightened and just. To make a command a "universal
law" is itself a steadying and elevating influence, and
it is only by a measure of abstraction from the individual,
inner aspect of conduct that this can be achieved.
On the other hand, the not infrequent contrast between
law and justice, the substitution of technicality for substantials,
the conservatism which made Voltaire characterize
lawyers as the "conservators of ancient barbarous
usages," above all the success with which law has been
used to sanction or even facilitate nearly every form of
oppression, extortion, class advantage, or even judicial
murder, is a constant attestation of the twofold possibilities
inherent in all institutions. Government in other
functions exhibits similar possibilities. At first it was
tyranny against which the subject had to defend himself.
Now it is rather the use of political machinery for private
gain. "Eternal vigilance" is the price not only of freedom,
but of every moral value.</p>

<p><b>The Religious Life.</b>&mdash;When freed from interdependence
with kinship, economic, and political association,
religion has an opportunity to become more personal and
more universal. When a man's religious attitude is not
fixed by birth, when worship is not so closely bound up
with economic interests, when there is not only religious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
"toleration," but religious liberty, the significance of religion
as a personal, spiritual relation comes to view. The
kinship tie is sublimated into a conception of divine fatherhood.
It becomes credible that Job does serve God "for
naught." Faith and purity of heart are not secured by
magistrates or laws.</p>

<p>And the universality of religion is no less a gain. So
far as religion was of the group it tended to emphasize
the boundary between Jew and Gentile, Greek and Barbarian,
between the "we-group" and the "others-group."
But when this group religion gave place to a more universal
religion, the kingdom of Israel could give place
to the kingdom of God; brotherhood could transcend
family or national lines. In the fierce struggles of the
Middle Ages the church was a powerful agency for restraining
the powerful and softening the feuds of hostile
clans and peoples. The "peace of God" was not only
a symbol of a far-off ideal, but an actual relief. The
universality might indeed be sought by force in a crusade
of Christian against Moslem, or in the horror of a thirty
years' war between Catholic and Protestant. But as the
conception of religion as a spiritual relation becomes
clearer, the tendency must inevitably be to disclose religion
as essentially a unifying rather than a divisive and discordant
force. If any religion becomes universal it will
be because of its universal appeal. And so far as it does
make universal appeal, like science, like art, it invites
its followers.</p>

<p>The differentiation of the moral from the religious
is often difficult to trace. For the religious has often been
the agency through which certain of the characteristics
of the moral have been brought about. The inward and
voluntary aspect of the moral, as compared with the verdicts
of law or public opinion, has been emphasized. But this
is often developed by the religious conceptions of an all-seeing
God, an all-wise judge. "Man looketh on the outer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
appearance, but the Lord looketh upon the heart" has its
literary parallels in Xenophon and Plato and Shakspere.
The distinction between higher and lower values has
received its most impressive symbol in the conception of
"another world," in which there is neither pain nor sin,
but eternal blessedness and eternal life. Ideals of character,
when embodied in divine persons, command love,
reverence, and devotion in supreme degree. A society
in which love and justice are the law of life has seemed
more possible, more potent to inspire sacrifice and enthusiasm,
when envisaged as the Kingdom of God. But
in all these illustrations we have, not the religious as
distinct from the moral, but the religious as modified
by the moral and embodying the moral in concrete examples
and imagery. We can see the two possible types
of development, however, in the concrete instances of the
Hebrews and the Greeks. In Israel religion was able to
take up the moral ideals and become itself more completely
ethical. The prophets of religion were at the same
time the moral reformers. But in Greece, in spite of the
efforts of some of the great poets, the religious conceptions
for the most part remained set and hence became
superstition, or emotional orgy, or ecstasy, while the moral
found a distinct path of its own. Religion at present
is confronting the problem of whether it will be able to
take up into itself the newer ethical values&mdash;the scientific
spirit which seeks truth, the enhanced value of human
worth which demands higher types of social justice.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>A brief characterization of the respective standpoints
of religion and morality may be added, as they both aim
to control and give value to human conduct. The religious
has always implied some relation of man's life
to unseen powers or to the cosmos. The relation may be
the social relation of kin or friend or companion, the
political of subject to a sovereign, the cosmic relation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
dependence, or that of seeking in the divine completer
meaning or more perfect fulfillment for what is fragmentary
and imperfect. In its aspect of "faith" it holds
all these ideals of power, wisdom, goodness, justice, to
be real and effective. The moral, on the other hand, concerns
itself, not with unseen beings or cosmic reality, but
with human purposes and the relations of a man to his
fellows. For religion, conscience may be the "voice of
God"; for morality, it must be stated in terms of thought
and feeling. The "moral law" must be viewed as a law
which is capable of being approved, at least&mdash;and this
implies that it may also be criticized&mdash;by the mind. The
difference which religion states as a choice between "God
and mammon," between heaven and earth, morality must
state in terms of good and evil, right and wrong, ideal
interests and natural appetites. Instead of regarding
its standards as laws established once for all by a divine
authority, morality seeks to reach <i>principles</i>. Instead
of embodying its ideals in persons, the moral seeks to
reshape them continually. It is for religion to hold
that "God reigns," and therefore "All's right with the
world." The moral as such must be continually overcoming
evil, continually working out ideals into conduct,
and changing the natural order into a more rational and
social order.</p>

<br /><br />

THE MORAL SITUATION</h2>


<p><b>Object of Part Two and of Present Chapter.</b>&mdash;From
the history of morals, we turn to the theoretical analysis
of reflective morality. We are concerned to discover
(1) just what in conduct it is that we judge good and
evil, right and wrong (conduct being a complicated
thing); (2) what we mean by good and evil, right and
wrong; (3) on what basis we apply these conceptions
to their appropriate objects in conduct. But before
we attempt these questions, we must detect and identify
the <i>moral situation</i>, the situation in which considerations
of good and evil, right and wrong, present themselves
and are employed. For some situations we employ
the ideas of true and false; of beautiful and ugly;
of skilful and awkward; of economical and wasteful,
etc. We may indeed apply the terms right and wrong
to these same situations; but if so, it is to them
in some other light. What then are the differentiating
traits, the special earmarks, presented by the situation
which we identify as distinctively moral? For we use
the term moral in a broad sense to designate that which
is either moral or immoral: i.e., right or wrong in the
narrower sense. It is the moral situation in the broad
sense as distinct from the non-moral, not from the immoral,
that we are now concerned with.</p>

<p><b>The Moral Situation Involves Voluntary Activity.</b>&mdash;It
will be admitted on all hands that the moral situation
is one which, whatever else it may or may not be,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
involves a voluntary factor. Some of the chief traits of
voluntary activity we have already become acquainted
with, as in the account by Aristotle, already noted (<i>ante</i>,
p. 12). The agent must know what he is about; he
must have some idea of what he is doing; he must not
be a somnambulist, or an imbecile, or insane, or an infant
so immature as to have no idea of what he is doing.
He must also have some wish, some desire, some preference
in the matter. A man overpowered by superior force
might be physically compelled by some ingenious device
to shoot a gun at another, knowing what he was doing,
but his act would not be voluntary because he had no
choice in the matter, or rather because his preference
was not to do the act which he is aware he is doing. But
if he is ordered to kill another and told if he does not he
will himself be killed, he has <i>some</i> will in the matter. He
may do the deed, not because he likes it or wishes it in
itself, but because he wishes to save his own life. The
attendant circumstances may affect our judgment of the
kind and degree of morality attaching to the act; but they
do not take it entirely out of the moral sphere.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Aristotle
says the act must also be the expression of a disposition
(a habit or &#7957;&#958;&#953;&#962;), a more or less settled tendency
on the part of the person. It must bear some relation to
his character. Character is not, we may say, a third factor,
It is making clear what is implied in deliberation and wish.
There may be little deliberation in a child's act and little
in an adult's, and yet we may regard the latter as much
more voluntary than the child's. With the child, the
thought is superficial and casual, because of the restricted
stage of organization or growth reached (see p. 10):
his act flows from organic instinct or from accidental
circumstances&mdash;whim, caprice, and chance suggestion, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
fancy. The adult's act may flow from habitual tendencies
and be accompanied by an equally small amount of conscious
reflection. But the tendencies themselves are the outcome
of prior deliberations and choices which have finally
got funded into more or less automatic habits. The child's
act is to a slight extent the expression of character; the
adult's to a large extent. In short, we mean by character
whatever lies behind an act in the way of deliberation and
desire, whether these processes be near-by or remote.</p>

<p><b>Not Everything Voluntary is Morally Judged.</b>&mdash;A
voluntary act may then be defined as one <i>which manifests
character</i>, the test of its presence being the presence
of desire and deliberation; these sometimes being present
directly and immediately, sometimes indirectly and remotely
through their effects upon the agent's standing
habits. But we do not judge all voluntary activity from
the moral standpoint. Some acts we judge from the
standpoint of skill or awkwardness; others as amusing
or boring; others as stupid or highly intelligent, and so
on. We do not bring to bear the conceptions of right
and wrong. And on the other hand, there are many
things called good and bad which are not voluntary.
Since what we are in search of must lie somewhere between
these two limits, we may begin with cases of the
latter sort.</p>

<p><i>(1) Not Everything Judged Good or Right is Moral.</i>&mdash;We
speak, for example, of an ill-wind; of a good
engine; of a watch being wrong; or of a screw being set
right. We speak of good and bad bread, money, or
soil. That is, from the standpoint of value, we judge
things as <i>means</i> to certain results in themselves desirable
or undesirable. A "good" machine does efficiently the
work for which it is designed; "bad" money does not
subserve the ends which money is meant to promote;
the watch that is wrong comes short of telling us time
correctly.  We have to use the notion of value and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of contribution to value; that is a positive factor. But
this contribution to valuable result is not, in inanimate
objects, something meant or intended by the things themselves.
If we thought the ill-wind had an idea of its
own destructive effect and took pleasure in that idea, we
should attribute moral quality to it&mdash;just as men did in
early times, and so tried to influence its behavior in order
to make it "good." Among things that promote favorable
or unfavorable results a line is drawn between those
which just do so as matter of fact, and those in which
meaning so to do, or intention, plays a part.</p>

<p><b>(2) Good in Animal Conduct.</b>&mdash;Let us now consider
the case of good and bad animal conduct. We speak of a
good watch-dog; of a bad saddle-horse, and the like.
Moreover, we <i>train</i> the dog and the horse to the right or
desired kind of action. We make, we repair the watch;
but we do not <i>train</i> it. Training involves a new factor:
enlistment of the animal's tendencies; of its own conscious
attitudes and reactions. We pet, we reward by feeding, we
punish and threaten. By these means we induce animals to
exercise in ways that form the habits we want. We modify
the animal's behavior by modifying its own impulses. But
we do not give moral significance to the good and bad, for
we are still thinking of means to ends. We do not suppose
that we have succeeded in supplying the hunting
dog, for example, with <i>ideas</i> that certain results are more
excellent than others, so that henceforth he acts on the
basis of his own discrimination of the less and the more
valuable. We just induce certain habits by managing
to make certain ways of acting <i>feel</i> more agreeable than
do others. Thus James says: "Whether the dog has the
notion of your being angry or of your property being
valuable in any such abstract way as <i>we</i> have these notions,
is more than doubtful. The conduct is more likely
an impulsive result of a conspiracy of outward stimuli;
the beast <i>feels like</i> acting so when these stimuli are pres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ent,
though conscious of no definite reason why"<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> (<i>Psychology</i>,
Vol. II., p. 350, note). Or putting it the other
way: if the dog has an idea of the results of guarding
the house, and is controlled in what he does by loyalty to
this idea, by the satisfaction which he takes in it, then
in calling the dog good we mean that in being good for
a certain result, he is also morally good.</p>

<p><b>(3) Non-moral Human Acts.</b>&mdash;There are also acts
evoked by an idea of value in the results to be reached,
which are not judged as coming within the moral sphere.
"Conduct is three-fourths of life," but in some sense it is
more: it is four-fourths. All conscious human life is
concerned with ends, and with selecting, arranging, and
employing the means, intellectual, emotional, and practical,
involved in these ends. This makes <i>conduct</i>. But
it does not follow that all conduct has <i>moral</i> import.
"As currently conceived, stirring the fire, reading a newspaper,
or eating a meal, are acts with which morality
has no concern. Opening the window to air the room,
putting on an overcoat when the weather is cold, are
thought of as having no ethical significance. These, however,
are all portions of conduct" (Spencer, <i>Principles of
Ethics</i>, Vol. I., p. 5). They all involve the idea of some
result worth reaching, and the putting forth of energy
to reach the result&mdash;of intelligently selected and adapted
means. But this may leave the act morally indifferent&mdash;innocent.</p>

<p><b>Introduction of Moral Factor.</b>&mdash;A further quotation
from Spencer may introduce discussion of the needed
moral qualification:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As already said, a large part of the ordinary conduct is indifferent.
Shall I walk to the water fall today? or, shall I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>ramble along the sea shore? Here the ends are ethically
indifferent. If I go to the water fall, shall I go over the
moor or take the path through the wood? Here the means
are ethically indifferent.... But if a friend who is with me
has explored the sea shore, but has not seen the water fall,
the choice of one or other end is no longer ethically indifferent.
Again, if a probable result of making the one excursion
rather than the other, is that I shall not be back in
time to keep an appointment, or if taking the longer route entails
this risk while the shorter does not, the decision in favor
of one end or means acquires in another way an ethical
character" (Spencer, <i>Principles of Ethics</i>, pp. 5-6).</p></div>

<p>This illustration suggests two differing types of conduct;
two differing ways in which activity is induced and guided
by ideas of valuable results. In one case the end presents
itself directly as desirable, and the question is only as
to the steps or means of achieving this end. Here we have
conduct which, although excited and directed by considerations
of value, is still morally indifferent. Such is the
condition of things <i>wherever one end is taken for granted
by itself without any consideration of its relationship
to other ends</i>. It is then a technical rather than a
moral affair. It is a question of taste and of skill&mdash;of
personal preference and of practical wisdom, or of
economy, expediency. There are many different roads to
most results, and the selection of this path rather than
that, on the assumption that either path actually leads
to the end, is an intellectual, &aelig;sthetic, or executive, rather
than an ethical matter. I may happen to prefer a marine
view to that of the uplands&mdash;that is an &aelig;sthetic interest.
I may wish to utilize the time of the walk for thinking,
and may find the moor path less distracting; here is a
matter of intellectual economy. Or I may conclude that
I shall best get the exercise I want by going to the water
fall. Here it is a question of "prudence," of expediency,
or practical wisdom. Let any one of the ends, &aelig;sthetic,
intellectual, hygienic, stand alone and it is a fit and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
proper consideration. The moral issue does not arise.
Or the various ends may be regarded as means to a
further unquestioned end&mdash;say a walk with the maximum
of combined &aelig;sthetic interest and physical exercise.</p>

<p><b>(4) Criterion for Moral Factor.</b>&mdash;But let the value of
one proposed end be felt to be really incompatible with
that of another, let it be felt to be so opposed as
to appeal to a different kind of interest and choice, in
other words, to different kinds of disposition and agency,
and we have a moral situation. This is what occurs when
one way of traveling means self-indulgence; another,
kindliness or keeping an engagement. There is no longer
one end, nor two ends so homogeneous that they may be
reconciled by both being used as means to some more
general end of undisputed worth. We have alternative
ends so heterogeneous that choice has to be made; an
end has to be developed out of conflict. The problem now
becomes what <i>is</i> really valuable. It is the <i>nature</i> of the
valuable, of the desirable, that the individual has to pass
upon.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Suppose a person has unhesitatingly accepted an end,
has acquiesced in some suggested purpose. Then, starting
to realize it, he finds the affair not so simple. He is led to
review the matter and to consider what really constitutes
worth for him. The process of attainment calls for toil
which is disagreeable, and imposes restraints and abandonments
of accustomed enjoyments. An Indian boy,
for example, thinks it desirable to be a good rider, a skilful
shot, a sagacious scout. Then he "naturally," as we
say, disposes of his time and energy so as to realize
his purpose. But in trying to become a "brave," he finds
that he has to submit to deprivation and hardship, to
forego other enjoyments and undergo arduous toil. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
finds that the end does not mean in actual realization what
it meant in original contemplation&mdash;something that often
happens, for, as Goldsmith said: "In the first place, we
cook the dish to our own appetite; in the latter, nature
cooks it for us."</p>

<p>This change in apparent worth raises a new question:
Is the aim first set up of the value it seemed to be? Is
it, after all, so important, so desirable? Are not other
results, playing with other boys, convivial companionship,
which are reached more easily and pleasantly, really more
valuable? The labors and pains connected with the means
employed to reach an end, have thrown another and incompatible
end into consciousness. The individual no
longer "naturally," but "morally," follows the selected
end, whichever of the two it be, because it has been chosen
after conscious valuation of competing aims.</p>

<p>Such competitions of values for the position of control
of action are inevitable accompaniments of individual
conduct, whether in civilized or in tribal life. A child,
for example, finds that the fulfillment of an appetite
of hunger is not only possible, but that it is desirable&mdash;that
fulfillment brings, or is, satisfaction, not mere satiety.
Later on, moved by the idea of this sort of value, he
snatches at food. Then he is made aware of other sorts
of values involved in the act performed&mdash;values incompatible
with just the value at which he aimed. He brings down
upon himself social disapproval and reproach. He is
termed rude, unmannerly, greedy, selfish. He acted in
accordance with an unhesitatingly accepted idea of value.
But while reaching one result he accomplished also certain
other results which he did not intend, results in the
way of being thought ill of, results which are disagreeable:
<i>negative values</i>. He is taught to raise the question
of what, after all, in such cases is the <i>really</i> desirable or
valuable. Before he is free to deliberate upon means, he
has to form an estimate of the relative worth of various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
possible ends, and to be willing to forego one and select
the other. The chapters on Hebrew and Greek moral
development have shown this same process at work in the
life of a people.</p>

<p><b>Summary and Definition.</b>&mdash;If we sum up the three
classes of instances thus far considered, we get the following
defining traits of a moral situation, that is,
of one which is an appropriate subject of determinations
of right and wrong: Moral experience is (1) a matter
of <i>conduct</i>, <i>behavior</i>; that is, of activities which are called
out by <i>ideas of the worth, the desirability of results</i>. This
evocation by an <i>idea</i> discriminates it from the so-called
behavior of a pump, where there is no recognition of results;
and from conduct attributed to the lower animals,
where there are probably feelings and even dim imagery,
but hardly ideas of the comparative desirability or value
of various ends. Moral experience is (2) that kind of
conduct in which there are ends so discrepant, so incompatible,
as to require selection of one and rejection of
the other. This perception of, and selection from, incompatible
alternatives, discriminates moral experience from
those cases of conduct which are called out and directed
by ideas of value, but which do not necessitate passing
upon the <i>real worth</i>, as we say, of the value selected.
It is incompatibility of ends which necessitates consideration
of the true worth of a given end; and such
consideration it is which brings the experience into the
moral sphere. Conduct as moral may thus be defined as
<i>activity called forth and directed by ideas of value or
worth, where the values concerned are so mutually incompatible
as to require consideration and selection before an
overt action is entered upon</i>.</p>

<p><b>End Finally at Issue.</b>&mdash;Many questions about ends are
in reality questions about means: the artist considers
whether he will paint a landscape or a figure; this or
that landscape, and so on. The general character of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
end is unchanged: it is to paint. But let this end persist
and be felt as desirable, as valuable; let at the same
time an alternative end presents itself as also desirable
(say keeping an engagement), so that the individual does
not find any way of adjusting and arranging them into
a common scheme (like doing first one and then the other),
and the person has a moral problem on his hands. Which
shall he decide for, and why? The appeal is to himself;
what does <i>he</i> really think the desirable end? What
makes the supreme appeal to him? What sort of an
agent, of a person, shall he be? This is the question finally
at stake in any genuinely moral situation: What shall the
agent <i>be</i>? What sort of a character shall he assume?
On its face, the question is what he shall <i>do</i>, shall he act
for this or that end. But the incompatibility of the ends
forces the issue back into the question of the kinds of
selfhood, of agency, involved in the respective ends. The
distinctively moral situation is then one in which elements
of value and control are bound up with the processes
of deliberation and desire; and are bound up in a peculiar
way: <i>viz.</i>, they decide what kind of a character shall
control further desires and deliberations. When ends are
genuinely incompatible, no common denominator can be
found except by deciding what sort of character is most
highly prized and shall be given supremacy.</p>

<p><b>The Moral and Indifferent Situations.</b>&mdash;This criterion
throws lights upon our earlier discussion of morally indifferent
acts. Persons perform the greater bulk of their activities
without any conscious reference to considerations
of right and wrong, as any one may verify for himself by
recollecting the general course of his activity on any ordinary
day from the time he arises in the morning to the
time he goes to bed at night. His deliberations and wants
are mostly concerned with the ends involved in his regular
vocation and recreations. But at any time the question of
his character as concerned with what he is doing may arise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
for judgment. The person may later on realize that the
type or kind of character which is to prevail in his further
activity was involved in deeds which were performed without
any such thought. He <i>then</i> judges them morally, approving
or disapproving. On the other hand, a course of
action which at the time presented a moral crisis even, may
afterwards come to be followed as a matter of course.
There is then no <i>fixed</i> line between the morally indifferent
and the morally significant. Every act is <i>potential</i> subject-matter
of moral judgment, for it strengthens or weakens
some habit which influences whole classes of judgments.</p>

PROBLEMS OF MORAL THEORY</h2>


<p>We have identified in its framework and main outlines
the sort of voluntary activity in which the problem of
good and evil appears and in which the ideas of right and
wrong are employed. This task, however, is only preliminary
to theoretical analysis. For it throws no light upon
just what we mean by good and bad; just what elements of
complex voluntary behavior are termed right or wrong; or
why they are so termed. It does not even indicate what
must be discovered before such questions can be answered.
It only sets forth the limits of the subject-matter within
which such questions arise and in reference to which
they must be answered. What are the distinctive problems
which must be dealt with in the course of such a
discussion?</p>

<p><b>Growth of Theory from Practical Problems.</b>&mdash;Of one
thing we may be sure. If inquiries are to have any substantial
basis, if they are not to be wholly up in the air,
the theorist must take his departure from the problems
which men actually meet in their own conduct. He may
define and refine these; he may divide and systematize; he
may abstract the problems from their concrete contexts
in individual lives; he may classify them when he has thus
detached them; but if he gets away from them he is talking
about something which his own brain has invented,
not about moral realities. On the other hand, the perplexities
and uncertainties of direct and personal behavior invite
a more abstract and systematic impersonal treatment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
than that which they receive in the exigencies of their occurrence.
The recognition of any end or authority going beyond
what is embodied in existing customs, involves some
appeal to thought, and moral theory makes this appeal more
explicit and more complete. If a child asks why he should
tell the truth, and is answered, "because you ought to and
that is reason enough"; or, "because it will prove profitable
for you to do so"; or, "because truth-telling is a condition
of mutual communication and common aims," the answer
implies a principle which requires only to be made explicit
to be full-fledged theory. And when this principle is
compared with those employed in other cases to see if they
are mutually consistent; and if not, to find a still more
fundamental reconciling principle, we have passed over
the border into ethical system.</p>

<p><b>Types of Theoretical Problems.</b>&mdash;The practical problems
which a thoughtful and progressive individual must
consider in his own conduct will, then, give the clue to the
genuine problems of moral theory. The framework of
one is an outline of the other. The man who does not satisfy
himself with sheer conventional conformity to the customs,
the <i>ethos</i>, of his class will find such problems as the following
forced upon his attention:&mdash;(1) He must consider
the <i>meaning</i> of habits which have been formed more or less
unreflectively&mdash;by imitation, suggestion, and inculcation
from others&mdash;and he must consider the meaning of those customs
about him to which he is invited to conform till they
have become personal habits. This problem of discovering
the meaning of these habits and customs is the problem of
stating what, after all, is <i>really</i> good, or worth while in
conduct. (2) The one whose morality is of the reflective
sort will be faced by the problem of moral advance, of
progress beyond the level which has been reached by this
more or less unreflective taking on of the habits and ideas
of those about him, progress up to the level of his own
reflective insight. Otherwise put, he has to face the prob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>lem
of what is to be the place and r&ocirc;le in his own conduct
of ideals and principles generated not by custom but by
deliberation and insight. (3) The individual must consider
more consciously the relation between what is currently
regarded as good by the social groups in which he
is placed and in which he has to act, and that regarded as
good by himself. The moment he ceases to accept conformity
to custom as an adequate sanction of behavior, he is met by
discrepancy between his personally conceived goods and
those reigning in the customs about him. Now while this
detachment makes possible the birth of higher and more
ideal types of morality, and hence of systematic effort for
social reform and advance; it also makes possible (as we
have seen on the historical side, p. 189) a more generalized
and deliberate selfishness; a less instinctive and more intentional
pursuit of what the individual judges to be good
<i>for himself</i> against what society exacts as good for itself.
The same reflective attitude which generates the conscientious
moral reformer may generate also a more deliberate
and resolute anti-social egoism. In any case, the individual
who has acquired the habit of moral reflection, is
conscious of a new problem&mdash;the relation of public good
to individual good. In short, the individual who is
thoughtfully serious and who aims to bring his habit of reflection
to bear on his conduct, will have occasion (1) to
search for the elements of good and bad, of positive and
negative, value in the situations that confront him; (2)
to consider the methods and principles by which he shall
reach conclusions, and (3) to consider the relations between
himself, his own capacities and satisfactions, and
the ends and demands of the social situations in which he
is placed.</p>

<p><b>The Corresponding Problems of Theory.</b>&mdash;Theory will
then have similar problems to deal with. (1) What is the
Good, the end in any voluntary act? (2) How is this
good known? Is it directly perceived, and if so, how? Or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
is it worked out through inquiry and reflection? And if
so, how? (3) When the good is known, how is it <i>acknowledged</i>;
how does it acquire authority? What is the place
of <i>law</i>, of control, in the moral life? Why is it that some
ends are attractive of themselves, while others present
themselves as <i>duties</i>, as involving subordination of what
is naturally attractive? (4) What is the place of selfhood
in the moral process? And this question assumes
two forms: (a) What is the relation of the good of the self
to the good of others? (b) What is the difference between
the morally good and the morally bad in the self? What
are virtues and vices as dispositions of the self? These
abstract and formal questions will become more concrete if
we consider them briefly in the order of their development
in the history of the moral theory.</p>

<p><b>Problem of Knowledge of Good Comes First in Theory.</b>&mdash;The
clash and overlapping of customs once so local as
to be isolated, brought to Athenian moral philosophers the
problem of discovering the underlying and final good to
which all the conflicting values of customs might be referred
for judgment. The movement initiated by Socrates
was precisely the effort to find out what is the real
good, the true end, of all the various institutions, customs,
and procedures current among men. The explanation of
conflict among men's interests, and of lack of consistency
and unity in any given person's behavior, of the division of
classes in the state, of the diverse recommendations of different
would-be moral teachers, was that they were ignorant
of their own ends. Hence the fundamental precept
is "Know thyself," one's own end, one's good and one's
proper function. Different followers of Socrates gave
very different accounts of knowledge, and hence proposed
very different final aims. But they all agreed that the
problem of knowing the good was the central problem, and
that if this were settled, action in accord with good would
follow of itself. Could it be imagined that man could know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
his own good and yet not seek it? Ignorance of good is
evil and the source of evil; insight into the real good will
clear up the confusion and partiality which makes men
pursue false ends and thus straighten out and put in
order conduct. Control would follow as a matter of
course from <i>knowledge</i> of the end. Such control would be
no matter of coercion or external restriction, but of subordination
and organization of minor ends with reference to
the final end.</p>

<p><b>Problem of Motive Force.</b><a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>&mdash;The problem of attaining
this knowledge was seen to be attended, however, by peculiar
obstructions and difficulties, the growing recognition
of which led to a shifting of the problem itself. The
dilemma, in brief, was this: The man who is already good
will have no difficulty in knowing the good both in general
and in the specific clothing under which it presents
itself in particular cases. But the one who does not yet
know the good, does not know <i>how</i> to know it. His ignorance,
moreover, puts positive obstacles in his way, for
it leads him to delight in superficial and transitory
ends. This delight increases the hold of these ends upon
the agent; and thus it builds up an <i>habitual</i> interest in
them which renders it impossible for the individual to get
a glimpse of the final end, to say nothing of a clear and
persisting view. <i>Only if the individual is habituated, exercised,
practiced in good ends so as to take delight in them,
while he is still so immature as to be incapable of really
knowing how and why they are good, will he be capable of
knowing the good when he is mature.</i> Pleasure in right
ends and pain in wrong must operate as a motive force in
order to give experience of the good, before knowledge
can be attained and operate as the motor force.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Division of Problem.</b>&mdash;But the exercise and training
requisite to form the habits which make the individual rejoice
in right activity before he knows how and why it is
right, presuppose adults who already have knowledge of
the good. They presuppose a social order capable not
merely of giving theoretic instruction, but of habituating
the young to right practices. But where shall such adults
be found, and where is the social order so good that it is
capable of right training of its own immature members?
Hence the problem again shifts, breaking up into two
parts. On the one hand, attention is fixed upon the irrational
appetites, desires, and impulses, which hinder apprehension
of the good; on the other, it is directed to the political
laws and institutions which are capable of training
the members of the State into a right manner of living.
For the most part, these two problems went their
own way independently of each other, a fact which resulted
in the momentous breach between the inner and
"spiritual," and the outer and "physical" aspects of
behavior.</p>

<p><b>Problem of Control of Affections and Desires.</b>&mdash;If it is
the lively movements of natural appetites and desires
which make the individual apprehend false goods as true
ones, and which present obstacles to knowledge of the true
good, the serious problem is evidently to check and so far
as possible to abolish the power of desire to move the mind.
Since it is anger, fear, hope, despair, sexual desire which
make men regard particular things instead of the final end
as good, the great thing is wholly to free attention and
judgment from the influence of such passions. It may be
impossible to prevent the passions; they are natural perturbations.
But man can at least prevent his judgment
of what is good or bad from being modified by them.
The Stoic moral philosophers most emphasized the misleading
influence of desire and passion, and set up the
ideal of apathy (lack of passion) and "ataraxy" (ab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>sence
of being stirred up). The other moral schools, the
Sceptics and Epicureans, also made independence of mind
from influence of passion the immediate and working end;
the Sceptics because they emphasized the condition of mental
detachment and non-committal, which is the state appropriate
to doubt and uncertainty; the Epicureans because
the pleasures of the mind are the only ones not at
the mercy of external circumstances. Mental pleasures are
equable, and hence are the only ones which do not bring
reactions of depression, exhaustion, and subsequent pain.
The problem of moral theory is now in effect, if not in
name, that of <i>control</i>, of authority and subordination, of
checking and restraining desire and passion.</p>

<p><b>Problem of Control of Private Interests by Law.</b>&mdash;Such
views could at the best, however, affect only a comparatively
small number, the philosophers. For the great
masses of men in the Roman Empire, the problem existed
on the other line: by what laws and what administration
of laws to direct the outward acts of men into right
courses, courses at least sufficiently right so as to maintain
outward peace and unity through the vast empire. In the
Greek city-state, with its small number of free citizens all
directly participating in public affairs, it was possible to
conceive an ideal of a common good which should bind all
together. But in an Empire covering many languages,
religions, local customs, varied and isolated occupations,
a single system of administration and law exercised from
a single central source could alone maintain the requisite
harmony. The problems of legislations, codification, and
administration were congenial to the Latin mind, and were
forced by the actual circumstances. From the external
side, then, as well as from the internal, the problem of
control became dominant over that of value and the
good.</p>

<p><b>Problem of Unification.</b>&mdash;It was the province of the
moral philosophers, of the theologians, of the church to at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>tempt
a fusion of these elements of inner and outer control.
It was their aim to connect, to synthesize these factors into
one commanding and comprehensive view of life. But the
characteristic of their method was to suppose that the combination
could be brought about, whether intellectually or
practically, only upon a supernatural basis, and by supernatural
resources. From the side of the natural constitution
of both man and the State, the various elements of behavior
are so hopelessly at war with one another that
there is no health in them nor help from them. The appetites
and desires are directed only upon carnal goods and
form the dominant element in the person. Even when
reason gets glimpses of the good, the good seen is narrow
in scope and temporal in duration; and even then reason
is powerless as an adequate motive. "We perceive the better
and we follow the worse." Moreover, it is useless to
seek aid from the habituation, the education, the discipline
and restraint of human institutions. They themselves
are corrupt. The product of man's lower nature cannot be
capable of enlightening and improving that nature; at
most it can only restrain outer action by appealing to
fear. Only a divine revelation can make known man's
true end; and only divine assistance, embodied in the ordinances
and sacraments of the supernaturally founded
and directed church, can bring this knowledge home to
erring individuals so as to make it effectual. In theory
the conception of the end, the good, was supreme; but man's
true good is supernatural and hence can be achieved only
by supernatural assistance and in the next world. In
practice, therefore, the important thing for man in his
present condition is implicit reliance upon and obedience
to the requirements of the church. This represents on
earth the divine sovereign, ultimate source of all moral
law. In effect, the moral law became a net-work of ordinances,
prescriptions, commands, rewards, penalties, penances,
and remissions. The jural point of view was com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>pletely
enthroned.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> There was no problem; there was a
final, because a supernatural solution.</p>

<p><b>The Problems of Individuality and Citizenship.</b>&mdash;With
the Renaissance began the revolt against the jural view of
life. A sense of the joys and delights which attend the
free and varied exercise of human capacities in this world
was reborn. The first results were a demand for natural
satisfaction; the next a profound reawakening of the antique
civic and political consciousness. The first in its reaction
against the Middle Ages was more individualistic
than the Greek ideal, to which it was in some respects allied.
The Greek had emphasized the notion of value, but had conceived
this as generic, as the fulfillment of the essential nature
of man as man. But with the moderns, satisfaction,
the good, meant something direct, specific, personal; something
the individual as an individual could lay hold of and
possess. It was an individual right; it was final and inalienable.
Nothing had a right to intervene or deprive
the individual of it.</p>

<p>This extreme individualistic tendency was contemporaneous
with a transfer of interest from the supernatural
church-state over to the commercial, social, and political
bodies with which the modern man found himself identified.
The rise of the free cities, and more especially the development
of national states, with the growth of commerce and
exchange, opened to the individual a natural social whole.
With this his connections were direct, in this he gained
new outlets and joys, and yet it imposed upon him definite
responsibilities and exacted of him specific burdens.
If the individual had gained a new sense of himself as an
individual, he also found himself enmeshed in national
states of a power constantly increasing in range and intensity.
The problem of the moral theorists was to recon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>cile
these two tendencies, the individualistic and that of political
centralization. For a time, the individual felt the
social organization in which he was set to be, with whatever
incidental inconveniences, upon the whole an outlet
and re&euml;nforcement of prized personal powers. Hence in
observing its conditions, he was securing the conditions of
his own peace and tranquillity or even of his own freedom
and achievement. But the balance was easily upset, and
the problem of the relation of the individual and the social,
the private and the public, was soon forced into prominence;
a problem which in one form or other has been the central
problem of modern ethical theory.</p>

<p><b>Individualistic Problem.</b>&mdash;Only for a short time, during
the first flush of new achievement and of hopeful adventure,
did extreme individualism and social interests remain
na&iuml;vely combined. The individualistic tendency
found a convenient intellectual tool in a psychology which
resolved the individual into an association or series of
particular states of feeling and sensations; and the good
into a like collection of pleasures also regarded as particular
mental states. This psychological atomism made individuals
as separate and disconnected as the sensations
which constituted their selves were isolated and mutually
exclusive. Social arrangements and institutions were, in
theory, justifiable only as they could be shown to augment
the sum of pleasurable states of feeling of individuals.
And as, quite independent of any such precarious theory,
the demand for reform of institutions became more and
more imperative, the situation was packed by Rousseau
into a formula that man was naturally both free and good,
and that institutional life had enslaved and thereby depraved
him. At the same time, there grew up an enthusiastic
and optimistic faith in "Nature," in her kindly intentions
for the happiness of humanity, and in her potency to
draw it to perfection when artificial restrictions were once
out of the way. Individuals, separate in themselves and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
in their respective goods, were thereby brought into a complete
coincidence and harmony of interests. Nature's laws
were such that if the individual obeyed them in seeking his
own good he could not fail to further the happiness of
others. While there developed in France (with original
initiative from England) this view of the internal isolation
and external harmony of men, a counterpart movement
took place in Germany.</p>

<p><b>The Rationalistic Problem.</b>&mdash;German thought inherited
through both Roman law and the natural theology and
ethics of the church, the conception that man's rational
nature makes him sociable. Stoicism, with its materialistic
idealism, had taught that all true laws are natural, while
all laws of nature are diffusions and potencies of reason.
As they bind things together in the world, so they
bind men together in societies. Moral theory is "Natural
Law" conceived in this sense. From the laws of reason, regarded
as the laws of man's generic and hence sociable
nature, all the principles of jurisprudence and of individual
morals may be deduced. But man has also a sensuous
nature, an appetitive nature which is purely private and
exclusive. Since reason is higher than sense, the authority
of the State is magnified. The juristic point of view was
reinstated, but with the important change that the law
was that of a social order which is the realization of man's
own rational being.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> If the laws of the State were criticized,
the reply was that however unworthy the civic
regulations and however desirable their emendation, still
the State is the expression of the idea of reason, that is of
man in his true generic nature. Hence to attempt to overthrow
the government is to attack the fundamental and
objective conditions of moral or rational life. Without
the State, the particularistic, private side of man's nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
would have free sway to express itself. Man's true moral
nature is within. We are then left, from both the English-French
and the German sides, with the problem of the relation
of the individual and the social; of the relation of the
inner and outer, of the psychological structure of the
person and the social conditions and results of his behavior.</p>

<br /><br />

TYPES OF MORAL THEORY</h2>


<h4>&sect; 1. TYPICAL DIVISIONS OF THEORIES</h4>

<p><b>Problems and Theories.</b>&mdash;We were concerned in the
last chapter with the typical <i>problems</i> of moral theory.
But it was evident that theories themselves developed and
altered as now this, now that, problem was uppermost. To
regard the question of how to know the good as the central
problem of moral inquiry is already to have one type
of theory; to consider the fundamental problem to be
either the subordination or the satisfaction of desire is
to have other types. A classification of types of theory is
rendered difficult, a thoroughly satisfactory classification
almost impossible, by the fact that the problems arrange
themselves about separate principles leading to cross-divisions.
All that we may expect to do is somewhat arbitrarily
to select that principle which seems most likely to be
useful in conducting inquiry.</p>

<p><b>(1) Teleological and Jural.</b>&mdash;One of the fundamental
divisions arises from taking either Value or Duty, Good
or Right, as the fundamental idea. Ethics of the first
type is concerned above all with <i>ends</i>; hence it is frequently
called <i>teleological</i> theory (Greek &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;, end). To
the other type of theory, obligations, imperatives, commands,
law, and authority, are the controlling ideas. By
this emphasis, arise the <i>jural</i> theories (Latin, <i>jus</i>, law).
At some point, of course, each theory has to deal with the
factor emphasized by its rival. If we start with Law as
central, the good resides in these acts which conform to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
its obligations. The good is obedience to law, submission
to its moral authority. If we start from the Good, laws,
rules, are concerned with the means of defining or achieving
it.</p>

<p><b>(2) Individual and Institutional.</b>&mdash;This fundamental
division is at once cut across by another, arising from emphasizing
the problem of the individual and the social.
This problem may become so urgent as to force into
the background the conflict between teleological and jural
theories, while in any case it complicates and subdivides
them. We have individualistic and institutional types of
theory. Consider, for example, the following representative
quotations: "No school can avoid taking for the ultimate
moral aim a desirable <i>state of feeling</i> called by whatever
name&mdash;gratification, enjoyment, happiness. Pleasure
somewhere, at some time, <i>to some being or beings</i>, is an
element of the conception";<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and again,<a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> "the good is universally
the pleasurable." And while the emphasis is here
upon the good, the desirable, the same type of statement,
<i>as respects emphasis upon the individual</i>, may be made
from the side of duty. For example, "it is the very essence
of moral duty to be imposed by a man on himself."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
Contrast both of these statements with the following:
"What a man ought to do, or what duties he should fulfill
in order to be virtuous, is in an ethical community not
hard to say. He has to do nothing except what is presented,
expressed, and recognized in his established relations."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
"The individual has his truth, real existence, and
ethical status only in being a member of the State. His
particular satisfactions, activities, and way of life have in
this authenticated, substantive principle, their origin and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
result."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> And in another connection: "The striving for a
morality of one's own is futile and by its very nature impossible
of attainment. In respect to morality the saying
of one of the wisest men of antiquity is the true one. To
be moral is to live in accord with the moral tradition of
one's country."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Here both the good and the law of the
individual are placed on a strictly institutional basis.</p>

<p><b>(3) Empirical and Intuitional.</b>&mdash;Another cross-division
arises from consideration of the method of ascertaining
and determining the nature of moral distinctions: the
method of knowledge. From this standpoint, the distinction
of ethical theories into the <i>empirical</i> (&#7952;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#953;&#1008;&#972;&#962;)
and the <i>intuitional</i> (Latin, <i>intueor</i>, to look at or upon)
represents their most fundamental cleavage. One view
makes knowledge of the good and the right dependent
upon recollection of prior experiences and their conditions
and effects. The other view makes it an immediate apprehension
of the quality of an act or motive, a trait so intrinsic
and characteristic it cannot escape being seen. While
in general the empirical school has laid stress upon the
consequences, the consequences to be searched for were
considered as either individual or social. Some, like
Hobbes, have held that it was directed upon law; to knowledge
of the commands of the state. And similarly the direct
perception or intuition of moral quality was by
some thought to apply to recognition of differences of
value, and by others to acknowledgment of law and authority,
which again might be divine, social, or personal.
This division cleaves straight across our other bases of
classification. To describe a theory definitely, it would
then be necessary to state just where it stood with reference
to each possible combination or permutation of elements
of all three divisions. Moreover, there are theories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
which attempt to find a deeper principle which will bridge
the gulf between the two opposites.</p>

<p><b>Complexity of Subject-matter and Voluntary Activity.</b>&mdash;This
brief survey should at least warn us of the complexity
of the attempt to discriminate types of theory, and
put us on our guard against undue simplification. It may
also serve to remind us that various types of theory are not
arbitrary personal devices and constructions, but arise
because, in the complexity of the subject-matter, one element
or another is especially emphasized, and the other
elements arranged in different perspectives. As a rule, all
the elements are recognized in some form or other by all
theories; but they are differently placed and accounted for.
In any case, it is voluntary activity with which we are concerned.
The problem of analyzing voluntary activity into
its proper elements, and rightly arranging them, must
coincide finally with the problem of the relation of good
and law of control to each other, with the problem of the
nature of moral knowledge, and with that of the relation
of the individual and social aspects of conduct.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. DIVISION OF VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY INTO INNER AND
OUTER</h4>

<p><b>The What and How of Activity.</b>&mdash;Starting from the
side of the voluntary act, we find in it one distinction which
when forced into an extreme separation throws light upon
all three divisions in theory which have been noted. This
is the relation between desire and deliberation as mental
or private, and the deed, the doing, as overt and public.
Is there any intrinsic moral connection between the <i>mental</i>
and the <i>overt</i> in activity? We may analyze an act which
has been accomplished into two factors, one of which is
said to exist within the agent's own consciousness; while
the other, the external execution, carries the mental into
operation, affects the world, and is appreciable by others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Now on the face of the matter, these two things, while capable
of intellectual discrimination, are incapable of real
separation. The "mental" side, the desire and the deliberation,
is for the sake of determining what shall be <i>done</i>;
the overt side is for the sake of making real certain precedent
mental processes, which are partial and inadequate
till carried into effect, and which occur for the sake of
that effect. The "inner" and "outer" are really only the
"how" and the "what" of activity, neither being real or
significant apart from the other. (See <i>ante</i>, p. 6).</p>

<p><b>Separation into Attitude and Consequences.</b>&mdash;But
under the strain of various theories, this organic unity has
been denied; the inner and the outer side of activity have
been severed from one another. When thus divided, the
"inner" side is connected exclusively with the will, the disposition,
the character of the person; the "outer" side is
connected wholly with the consequences which flow from it,
the changes it brings about. Theories will then vary radically
according as the so-called inner or the so-called
outer is selected as the bearer and carrier of moral distinctions.
One theory will locate the moral quality of an
act in that <i>from</i> which it issues; the other in that <i>into</i>
which it issues.</p>

<p>The following quotations put the contrast in a nutshell,
though unfortunately the exact meaning of the second is
not very apparent apart from its context.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A motive is substantially nothing more than pleasure or
pain operating in a certain manner. Now pleasure is in itself
a good; nay, even setting aside immunity from pain, the only
good.... It follows, therefore, immediately and incontestably
that there is no such thing as any sort of motive that is
in itself a bad one. If motives are good or bad, it is only on
account of their effects" (Bentham, <i>Principles of Morals and
Legislation</i>, ch. x., &sect;2). Over against this, place the following
from Kant: "Pure reason is practical of itself alone, and
gives to man a universal law which we call the Moral Law....
If this law determines the will directly [without any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
reference to objects and to pleasure or pain] the action conformed
to it is good in itself; a will whose principle always
conforms to this law is good absolutely in every respect and
is the supreme condition of all good."</p></div>

<p>If now we recur to the distinction between the "what"
and the "how" of action in the light of these quotations,
we get a striking result. "What" one does is to pay
money, or speak words, or strike blows, and so on. The
"how" of this action is the spirit, the temper in which it is
done. One pays money with a hope of getting it back, or to
avoid arrest for fraud, or because one wishes to discharge
an obligation; one strikes in anger, or in self-defense, or in
love of country, and so on. Now the view of Bentham says
in effect that the "what" is significant, and that the "what"
consists ultimately only of the pleasures it produces; the
"how" is unimportant save as it incidentally affects resulting
feelings. The view of Kant is that the moral core
of every act is in its "how," that is in its spirit, its actuating
motive; and that the law of reason is the only right
motive. <i>What</i> is aimed at is a secondary and (except as
determined by the inner spirit, the "how" of the action) an
irrelevant matter. In short the separation of the mental
and the overt aspects of an act has led to an equally complete
separation of its initial spirit and motive from its
final content and consequence. And in this separation, one
type of theory, illustrated by Kant, takes its stand on the
actuating source of the act; the other, that of Bentham,
on its outcome. For convenience, we shall frequently refer
to these types of theories as respectively the "attitude"
and the "content"; the formal and the material; the disposition
and the consequences theory. The fundamental
thing is that <i>both</i> theories separate character and conduct,
disposition and behavior; which of the two is most emphasized
being a secondary matter.</p>

<p><b>Different Ways of Emphasizing Results.</b>&mdash;There are,
however, different forms of the consequences or "content"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
theory&mdash;as we shall, for convenience, term it. Some writers,
like Spencer as quoted, say the only consequences that are
good are simply pleasures, and that pleasures differ only in
<i>intensity</i>, being alike in everything but degree. Others
say, pleasure is the good, but pleasures differ in quality
as well as intensity and that a certain <i>kind</i> of pleasure
is the morally good. Others say that natural satisfaction
is not found in any one pleasure, or in any number of
them, but in a more permanent mood of experience, which
is termed <i>happiness</i>. Happiness is different from a pleasure
or from a collection of pleasures, in being an abiding
consequence or result, which is not destroyed even by the
presence of pains (while a pain ejects a pleasure). The
pleasure view is called Hedonism; the happiness view,
Eudaimonism.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p><b>Different Forms of the "Attitude" Theory.</b>&mdash;The opposite
school of theory holds that the peculiar character
of "moral" good is precisely that it is <i>not</i> found in consequences
of action. In this negative feature of the definition
many different writers agree; there is less harmony
in the positive statement of just what the moral
good is. It is an attribute or disposition of character,
or the self, not a trait of results experienced, and in general
such an attribute is called <i>Virtue</i>. But there are
as many differences of opinion as to what constitutes
virtue as there are on the other side as to what pleasure
and happiness are. In one view, it merges, in its outcome
at least, very closely with one form of eudaimonism.
If happiness be defined as the fulfillment of satisfaction
of the characteristic functions of a human being,
while a certain function, that of reason, is regarded as
<i>the</i> characteristic human trait whose exercise is <i>the</i> virtue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
or supreme excellence, it becomes impossible to maintain
any sharp line of distinction. Kant, however, attempted
to cut under this union of happiness and virtue, which
under the form of <i>perfectionism</i> has been attempted by
many writers, by raising the question of <i>motivation</i>. Why
does the person aim at perfection? Is it for the sake of
the resulting happiness? Then we have only Hedonism.
Is it because the moral law, the law of reason, requires
it? Then we have law morally deeper than the end
aimed at.</p>

<p>We may now consider the bearing of this discussion
upon theories of moral knowledge and (2) of moral
authority.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p><b>I. Characteristic Theories of Moral Knowledge.</b>&mdash;(1)
Those who set chief store by the goods naturally experienced,
find that past experiences supply all the data required
for moral knowledge. Pleasures and pains, satisfactions
and miseries, are recurrent familiar experiences. All
we have to do is to note them and their occasions (or, put
the other way, to observe the tendency of some of our impulses
and acts to bring pleasure as a consequence, of
others to effect misery), and to make up our ends and
aims accordingly. As a theory of moral knowledge,
Hedonism is thus almost always allied with <i>empiricism</i>,
understanding by empiricism the theory that particular
past experiences furnish the method of all ideas and
beliefs.</p>

<p>(2) The theory that the good is some type of virtuous
character requires a special organ to give moral knowledge.
Virtue is none the less the Good, even when it is
not attained, when it is not experienced, that is, as we
experience a pleasure. In any case, it is not good because
it is experienced, but because it <i>is</i> virtue. Thus the "attitude"
theory tends to connect itself with some form of In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>tuitionalism,
Rationalism, or Transcendentalism, all of
these terms meaning that there is something in knowledge
going beyond the particular experiences. Intuitionalism
holds there is a certain special faculty which reveals
truths beyond the scope of experience; Rationalism, that
beside the particular elements of experience there are
universal and necessary conceptions which regulate it;
Transcendentalism, that within experience there is a
factor derived from a source transcending experience.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p><b>II. Characteristic Theories of Moral Control.</b>&mdash;The
result school tends to view authority, control, law, obligation
from the standpoint of <i>means to an end</i>; the
moralistic, or virtue, school to regard the idea of <i>law</i> as
more fundamental than that of the good. From the first
standpoint, the authority of a given rule lies in its power
to regulate desires so that after all pleasures&mdash;or a maximum
of them, and a minimum of pains&mdash;may be had. At
bottom, it is a principle of expediency, of practical wisdom,
of adjustment of means to end. Thus Hume said:
"Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions"&mdash;that
is, the principles and rules made known by reason
are, at last, only instruments for securing the fullest satisfaction
of desires. But according to the point of view
of the other school, no satisfaction is <i>really</i> (i.e., morally)
good unless it is acquired in accordance with a law existing
independently of pleasurable satisfaction. Thus the
good depends upon the law, not the law upon the desirable
end.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. GENERAL INTERPRETATION OF THESE THEORIES</h4>

<p><b>The Opposition in Ordinary Life.</b>&mdash;To some extent,
similar oppositions are latent in our ordinary moral convictions,
without regard to theory.  Indeed, we tend, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
different times, to pass from one point of view to the
other, without being aware of it. Thus, as against the
identification of goodness with a <i>mere</i> attitude of will;
we say, "It is not enough for a man to be good; he must
be good for something." It is not enough to mean well;
one must mean to do well; to excuse a man by saying
"he <i>means</i> well," conveys a shade of depreciation. "Hell
is paved with good intentions." Good "resolutions," in
general, are ridiculed as not modifying overt action. A
tree is to be judged by its fruits. "Faith without works
is dead." A man is said "to be too good for this world"
when his motives are not effective. Sometimes we say,
"So and so is a <i>good</i> man," meaning to say that that is
about all that can be said for him&mdash;he does not count,
or amount to anything, practically. The objection to
identifying goodness with inefficiency also tends to render
suspected a theory which seems to lead logically to such
identification. More positively we dwell upon goodness
as involving <i>service</i>; "love is the fulfilling of the law,"
and while love is a trait of character, it is one which takes
immediate action in order to bring about certain definite
consequences. We call a man Pharisaical who cherishes his
own good character as an end distinct from the common
good for which it may be serviceable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, indicating the supremacy of the
voluntary attitude over consequences, we have, "What
shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" "What shall
it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his
own life?" "Let us do evil that good may come, whose damnation
is just." The deep-seated objection to the maxim
that the end justifies the means is hard to account for,
except upon the basis that it is possible to attain ends
otherwise worthy and desirable at the expense of conduct
which is immoral. Again, compare Shakspere's
"There's nothing right or wrong, but thinking makes
it so" with the Biblical "As a man thinketh in his heart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
so is he." And finally we have such sayings as, "Take
the will for the deed"; "His heart is in the right place";
<i>Pereat mundus, fiat justitia</i>.</p>

<p>Passing from this popular aspect of the matter, we
find the following grounds for the "content" theory:</p>

<p><b>1. It Makes Morality Really Important.</b>&mdash;Would there
be any use or sense in moral acts if they did not tend
to promote welfare, individual and social? If theft uniformly
resulted in great happiness and security of life,
if truth-telling introduced confusion and inefficiency into
men's relations, would we not consider the first a virtue,
and the latter a vice?<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> So far as the identification of
goodness with mere motive (apart from results effected by
acts) reduces morality to nullity, there seems to be furnished
a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the theory that results
are not the decisive thing.</p>

<p><b>(2) It Makes Morality a Definite, Concrete Thing.</b>&mdash;Morality
is found in consequences; and consequences
are definite, observable facts which the individual can be
made responsible for noting and for employing in the direction
of his further behavior. The theory gives morality
an objective, a tangible guarantee and sanction. Moreover,
results are something objective, common to different
individuals because outside them all. But the doctrine
that goodness consists in motives formed by and within
the individual without reference to obvious, overt results,
makes goodness something vague or else whimsical and
arbitrary. The latter view makes virtue either something
unattainable, or else attained by merely cultivating certain
internal states having no outward results at all, or even
results that are socially harmful. It encourages fanaticism,
moral crankiness, moral isolation or pride; obstinate
persistence in a bad course in spite of its demonstrable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
evil results. It makes morality non-progressive, since by
its assumption no amount of experience of consequences
can throw any light upon essential moral elements.</p>

<p><b>(3) The Content Theory Not Only Puts Morality
Itself upon a Basis of Facts, but Also Puts the Theory of
Morality upon a Solid Basis.</b>&mdash;We know what we mean
by goodness and evil when we discuss them in terms of
results achieved or missed, and can therefore discuss them
intelligibly. We can formulate concrete ends and lay
down rules for their attainment. Thus there can be
a science of morals just as there can be a science of any
body of observable facts having a common principle.
But if morality depends upon purely subjective, personal
motives, no objective observation and common interpretation
are possible. We are thrown back upon the capricious
individual <i>ipse dixit</i>, which by this theory is made final.
Ethical theory is rendered impossible. Thus Bentham,
who brings these charges (and others) against the
"virtue" theory of goodness, says at the close of the
preface to his <i>Principles of Morals and Legislation</i> (ed.
of 1823):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Truths that form the basis of political and moral science
are not to be discovered but by investigations as severe as
mathematical ones, and beyond all comparison more intricate
and extensive.... They are not to be forced into detached
and general propositions, unincumbered with explanations
and exceptions. They will not compress themselves into epigrams.
They recoil from the tongue and the pen of the declaimer.
They flourish not in the same soil with sentiment.
They grow among thorns; and are not to be plucked, like
daisies, by infants as they run.... There is no <i>King's Road</i>
... to legislative, any more than to mathematical science."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>Arguments not unlike, however, may be adduced in
favor of the attitude theory.</p>

<p><b>1. It, and It Alone, Places Morality in the High and
Authoritative Place Which by Right Characterizes It.</b>&mdash;Morality
is not just a means of reaching other ends;
it is an end in itself. To reduce virtue to a tool or instrumentality
for securing pleasure is to prostitute and destroy
it. Unsophisticated common sense is shocked at
putting morality upon the same level with prudence, policy,
and expediency. Morality is morality, just because
it possesses an absolute authoritativeness which they lack.</p>

<p><b>2. The Morally Good Must be Within the Power of the
Individual to Achieve.</b>&mdash;The amount of pleasure and
pain the individual experiences, his share of satisfaction,
depends upon outward circumstances which are beyond
his control, and which accordingly have no moral significance.
Only the beginning, the willing, of an act lies
with the man; its conclusion, its outcome in the way of
consequences, lies with the gods. Accident, misfortune,
unfavorable circumstance, may shut the individual within
a life of sickness, misery, and discomfort. They may deprive
him of external goods; but they cannot modify the moral
good, for that resides in the attitude with which one faces
these conditions and results. Conditions hostile to pros<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>perity
may be only the means of calling forth virtues
of bravery, patience, and amiability. Only consequences
within character itself, the tendency of an act to form a
habit or to cultivate a disposition, are really of moral
significance.</p>

<p><b>3. Motives Furnish a Settled and Workable Criterion
by Which to Measure the Rightness or Wrongness of
Specific Acts.</b>&mdash;Consequences are indefinitely varied; they
are too much at the mercy of the unforeseen to serve as
basis of measurement. One and the same act may turn
out in a hundred different ways according to accidental
circumstances. If the individual had to calculate consequences
before entering upon action, he would engage in
trying to solve a problem where each new term introduced
more factors. No conclusion would ever be reached;
or, if reached, would be so uncertain that the agent would
be paralyzed by doubt. But since the motives are within
the person's own breast, the problem of knowing the right
is comparatively simple: the data for the judgment are
always at hand and always accessible to the one who
sincerely wishes to know the right.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion.</b>&mdash;The fact that common life recognizes,
under certain conditions, both theories as correct, and
that substantially the same claims may be made for both,
suggests that the controversy depends upon some underlying
misapprehension. Their common error, as we shall
attempt to show in the sequel, lies in trying to split a
voluntary act which is single and entire into two unrelated
parts, the one termed "inner," the other, "outer";
the one called "motive," the other, "end." A voluntary
act is always a disposition, or habit of the agent <i>passing
into an overt act</i>, which, so far as it can, produces certain
consequences. A "mere" motive which does not do
anything, which makes nothing different, is not a genuine
motive at all, and hence is not a voluntary act. On the
other hand, consequences which are not intended, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
are not personally wanted and chosen and striven for,
are no part of a voluntary act. <i>Neither the inner
apart from the outer, nor the outer apart from the inner,
has any voluntary or moral quality at all. The former
is mere passing sentimentality or reverie; the latter is
mere accident or luck.</i></p>

<p><b>Tendency of Each Theory to Pass into the Other.</b>&mdash;Hence
each theory, realizing its own onesidedness, tends
inevitably to make concessions, and to borrow factors
from its competitor, and thus insensibly to bridge the gap
between them. Consequences are emphasized, but only
<i>foreseen</i> consequences; while to <i>foresee</i> is a mental act whose
exercise depends upon character. It is disposition, interest,
which leads an agent to estimate the consequences
at their true worth; thus an upholder of the "content"
theory ends by falling back upon the <i>attitude</i> taken in
forecasting and weighing results. In like fashion, the
representative of the motive theory dwells upon the tendency
of the motive to bring about certain effects. The
man with a truly benevolent disposition is not the one who
indulges in indiscriminate charity, but the one who considers
the effect of his gift upon its recipient and upon
society. While lauding the motive as the sole bearer of
moral worth, the motive is regarded as a force working
towards the production of certain <i>results</i>. When the
"content" theory recognizes disposition as an inherent
factor in bringing about consequences, and the "attitude"
theory views motives as forces tending to effect consequences,
an approximation of each to the other has taken
place which almost cancels the original opposition. It
is realized that a complete view of the place of motive
in a voluntary act will conceive motive as a motor force;
as inspiring to action which will inevitably produce
certain results unless this is prevented by superior external
force. It is also realized that only <i>those</i> consequences
are any part of voluntary behavior which are so con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>genial
to character as to appeal to it as good and stir
it to effort to realize them. <i>We may begin the analysis of a
voluntary act at whichever end we please, but we are
always carried to the other end in order to complete the
analysis.</i> The so-called distinction between the "inner"
and "outer" parts of an act is in reality a distinction
between the <i>earlier</i> and the <i>later</i> period of its development.</p>

<p>In the following chapter we shall enter upon a direct
discussion of the relation of conduct and character to one
another; we shall then apply the results of the discussion,
in successive chapters, to the problems already raised:
The Nature of Good; of Knowledge; of Moral Authority;
The Relation of the Self to Others and Society; The
Characteristics of the Virtuous Self.</p>

this phase of Utilitarianism appealed to him. (See pp. 65-67 of London
edition of 1874; see also his <i>Dissertations and Discussions</i>, Vol.
I., Essay on Bentham, especially pp. 339 and ff.) Bentham "introduced
into morals and politics those habits of thought, and modes
of investigation, which are essential to the idea of science; and the
absence of which made these departments of inquiry, as physics had
been before Bacon, a field of interminable discussion, leading to
no result. It was not his <i>opinions</i>, in short, but his <i>method</i>, that
constituted the novelty and value of what he did.... Bentham's
method may be shortly described as the method of <i>detail</i>.... Error
lurks in generalities."
</p><p>
Mill finally says: "He has thus, it is not too much to say, for the
first time introduced precision of thought in moral and political
philosophy. Instead of taking up their opinions by intuition, or by
ratiocination from premises adopted on a mere rough view, and
couched in language so vague that it is impossible to say exactly
whether they are true or false, philosophers are now forced to understand
one another, to break down the generality of their propositions,
and join a precise issue in every dispute. This is nothing
less than a revolution in philosophy." In view of the character
of the larger amount of discussions in moral and political philosophy
still current, Mill perhaps took a too optimistic view of the extent
to which this "revolution" had been accomplished.</p></div>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XIII</small>

<br /><br />

CONDUCT AND CHARACTER</h2>


<p><b>Problem of Chapter.</b>&mdash;We have endeavored in the preceding
chapters (1) to identify the sort of situation in
which the ideas of good and evil, right and wrong, in
their moral sense, are employed; (2) to set forth the
typical problems that arise in the analysis of this situation;
and (3) to name and describe briefly the types of
theory which have developed in the course of the history of
the problems. We have now to return to the moral situation
as described, and enter upon an independent analysis
of it. We shall commence this analysis, as was indicated
in the last chapter, by considering the question of the
relation of attitude and consequences to each other in
voluntary activity,&mdash;not that this is the only way to
approach the problem, but that it is the way which brings
out most clearly the points at issue among types of
moral theory which since the early part of the nineteenth
century have had the chief currency and influence.
Accordingly the discussion will be introduced by a statement
of the two most extreme doctrines that separate the
"inner" and the "outer," the "psychical" and the "overt"
aspects of activity: <i>viz.</i>, the Kantian, exclusively emphasizing
the "how," the spirit, and motive of conduct;
the Utilitarian, dwelling exclusively upon its "what," its
effects and consequences. Our positive problem is, of
course, by means of arraying these two extreme views
against each other, to arrive at a statement of the mutual
relations of attitude and act, motive and consequence,
character and conduct.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall begin with Kant as a representative of the
attitude theory.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. THE GOOD WILL OF KANT</h4>

<p>Kant says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nothing can possibly be conceived, in the world or out of
it, which can be called Good without qualification, except a
Good Will. Intelligence, wit, judgment, and the other talents
of the mind, however they may be named, or courage, resolution,
perseverance as qualities of temperament are individually
good and desirable in many respects; but these gifts of
nature may also become extremely bad and mischievous, if
the will which is to make use of them and which, therefore,
constitutes what is called character, is not good. It is the
same with the gifts of fortune. Power, riches, honor, even
health ... inspire pride and often presumption if there is
not a Good Will to correct the influence of these on the mind.
Moderation of the affections and passions, self-control and
calm deliberation are not only good in many respects, but even
seem to constitute part of the intrinsic worth of the person;
but they are far from deserving to be called good without
qualification ... for without the principles of a good will
they may become extremely bad. The coolness of a villain
makes him both more dangerous and more abominable" (Kant:
<i>Theory of Ethics</i>, tr. by Abbott, pp. 9-10).</p></div>

<p><b>Element of Truth in Statement.</b>&mdash;There can be no
doubt that in some respects these ideas of Kant meet
a welcome in our ordinary convictions. Gifts of fortune,
talents of mind, qualities of temperament, are regarded
as desirable, as good, but we qualify the concession. We
say they are good, if a good use is made of them; but
that, administered by a bad character, they add to power
for evil. Moreover, Kant's statement of the <i>intrinsic</i>
goodness of the Good Will, "A jewel which shines by its
own light" (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 10), awakens ready response in us.
Some goods we regard as means and conditions&mdash;health,
wealth, business, and professional success.  They afford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
moral opportunities and agencies, but need not possess
moral value in and of themselves; when they become parts,
as they may, of a moral good, it is because of their place
and context. Personality, character, has a dignity of
its own, which forbids that it be considered a simple
means for the acquisition of other goods. The man who
makes his good character a simple tool for securing
political preferment, is, we should say, prostituting and
so destroying his own goodness.</p>

<p><b>Ambiguity of Statement.</b>&mdash;The statement made by
Kant, however, is ambiguous and open to opposed interpretations.
The notion that the Good Will is good in
and of itself may be interpreted in two different ways:
(i) We may hold, for example, that honesty is good as
a trait of will because it tends inevitably to secure a
desirable relationship among men; it removes obstructions
between persons and keeps the ways of action clear and
open. Every man can count upon straightforward action
when all act from honesty; it secures for each singleness
of aim and concentration of energy. (ii) But we may
also mean that honesty is absolutely good as a trait
of character just in and by itself, quite apart from any
influence this trait of character has in securing and promoting
desirable ends. In one case, we emphasize its
goodness because it arranges for and tends towards certain
results; in the other case, we ignore the factor of
tendency toward results.</p>

<p><b>Kant's Interpretation of Goodness of Will is Formal.</b>&mdash;Kant's
further treatment leaves us in no doubt in which
of these two senses he uses the term Good Will. He goes
on (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 10):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A Good Will is good, not because of what it performs or
effects, <i>not by its aptness for the attainment of some proposed
end</i>, but simply by virtue of the volition; that is, it is
good in itself.... Even if it should happen that, owing to
the special disfavor of fortune, or the niggardly provision of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
a stepmotherly nature, this will should wholly lack power
to accomplish its purpose, if with its greatest efforts it should
yet achieve nothing, and there should remain only the Good
Will (not, to be sure, a mere wish, but the assuming of all
means in our power), then, like a jewel, it would still shine
by its own light as a thing which has its whole value in
itself. Its fruitfulness or fruitlessness can neither add nor
take away anything from this value."</p></div>

<p>And again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"An action ... derives its moral worth not from the <i>purpose</i>
which is to be attained by it, but from the maxim by
which it is determined and therefore depends ... merely on
the principle of volition by which the action has taken place,
without regard to any <i>object of desire</i>.... The purposes
which we may have in view in our actions or their effect
regarded as ends and springs of will cannot give the actions
an unconditional or moral worth.... It cannot lie anywhere
but in the principle of the Will, without regard to the
ends which can be attained by the action" (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 16).</p></div>

<p><b>Relation of Endeavor and Achievement to Will.</b>&mdash;Here,
also, we find a certain agreement with our every-day
moral experience. It is undoubtedly true that in many
cases we ascribe moral worth or goodness to acts without
reference to the results actually attained by them; a man
who tries to rescue a drowning child is not judged only
on the basis of success. If he is prevented, because he
is crippled, or because the current is too rapid for him,
we do not refuse hearty moral approbation. We do not
judge the goodness of the act or of the agent from the
standpoint of its attained result, which here is failure.
We regard the man as good because he proposed to himself
a worthy end or aim, the rescue of another, even
at the risk of harm to himself. We should agree with
Kant in saying that the moral worth does not depend
on the <i>realization</i> of the object of desire. But we should
regard the worth of the man to consist precisely in the
fact that, so far as he was concerned, he <i>aimed at a good
result</i>. We do not rule out purpose, but we approve because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the purpose was good. By will we mean tendencies,
desires, and habits operating to realize results regarded
as desirable. Will is not the <i>sole</i> condition of reaching
a result&mdash;that is, of making the aim an actual fact. Circumstances
need to co&ouml;perate to insure a successful issue;
and if these fail, the best will in the world cannot secure
the transformation of desire for an end into that end.
We know that sometimes it is only by accident that the
desirable end is not effected, but we also know that without
the proper disposition it is only by accident that the
results <i>are</i> achieved. Moreover, we know that our own
attitude is not only an important condition of securing
the results, but that it is the only condition <i>constantly</i>
under our control. What we mean by calling it "ours"
is precisely that it is that condition whose operation lies
with us. Accordingly, it is the key and clue to the results,
so far as they concern us. So far, given desire and endeavor,
achievement is not necessary to volition.</p>

<p>"<b>Meaning Well.</b>"&mdash;On the other hand, can a man justify
himself on the ground that he "means well," if the
"meaning well" does not <i>regulate the overt acts</i> that he
performs, and hence the consequences that proceed from
them? Are we not justified in suspecting a person's good
faith when his good intentions uniformly bring suffering
to others? If we do not question his good faith, do we
not regard him as needing moral enlightenment, and a
change of disposition? We distinguish in our judgments
of good between the fanatic and the thoroughly selfish
man, but we do not carry this distinction to the point
of approving the fanatic; of saying, "Let him alone; he
means well, he has a good will, he is actuated by a sense
of duty." On the contrary, we condemn his aims; and in
so far we censure him for willingly entertaining ans approving
them. We may, indeed, approve of his character
with respect to its sincerity, singleness of aim, and its thoroughness
of effort, for such things, <i>taken by themselves</i>, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
in the abstract, are good traits of character. We esteem
them highly, however, just because they have so much
to do with results; they are, <i>par excellence</i>, executive
traits. But we do not approve of the man's whole character
in approving these traits. There is something the
matter with the man in whom good traits are put to a
bad use. It is not true in such cases that we approve
the <i>agent</i> but condemn his <i>acts</i>. We approve certain
phases of conduct, and in so far regard the doer as
praiseworthy; we condemn other features of acts, and in
so far disapprove him.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p><b>Overt Action Proves Will.</b>&mdash;Again, under what circumstances
do we actually "take the will for the deed"?
When do we assume that so far as the will was concerned
it did aim at the result and aimed at it thoroughly, without
evasion and without reservation? Only when there
is <i>some</i> action which testifies to the real presence of the
motive and aim.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The man, in our earlier instance, must
have made some effort to save the drowning child to justify
either us or himself in believing that he <i>meant</i> to do it;
that he had the right intent. The individual who habitually
justifies himself (either to others or to himself) by
insisting upon the rightness of his motives, lays himself
open to a charge of self-deception, if not of deliberate
hypocrisy, if there are no outward evidences of effort
towards the realization of his pretended motive. A
habitually careless child, when blamed for some disorder
or disturbance, seeks to excuse himself by saying he
"didn't mean to": i.e., he had no intention or aim; the
results did not flow morally from him. We often reply,
in effect, "that is just the trouble; you didn't mean at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
all; you ought to have meant <i>not</i> to do this." In other
words, if you had thought about what you were doing
you would not have done this and would not have brought
about the undesirable results. With adults there is such
a thing as culpable carelessness and blameworthy negligence.
So far as the individual's conscious will was
concerned, everything he deliberately intended may have
been entirely praiseworthy; but we blame him because
his character was such that the end appropriate to the
circumstances did not occur to him. We do not disapprove
when the failure to think of the right purpose
is due to inexperience or to lack of intellectual development;
but we do blame when the man does not employ his
attained experience and intellectual capacity. Given
these factors, if the right end is not thought of or is
quickly dismissed, indisposition is the only remaining
explanation. These two facts, that we require effort or evidence
of sincerity of good will and that the character is
disapproved for <i>not</i> entertaining certain aims, are sufficient
to prove that we do not identify will and motive
with something which has nothing to do with "aptness for
attaining ends." Will or character <i>means intelligent
forethought of ends and resolute endeavor to achieve
them</i>. It cannot be conceived apart from <i>ends</i> purposed
and desired.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. THE "INTENTION" OF THE UTILITARIANS</h4>

<p><b>Emphasis of Utilitarians upon Ends.</b>&mdash;We are brought
to the opposite type of moral theory, the utilitarian,
which finds moral quality to reside in consequences, that
is to say, in the ends achieved. To the utilitarians, motive
means simply certain states of consciousness which happen
to be uppermost in a man's mind as he acts. Not
this subjective feeling existing only in the inner consciousness,
but the external outcome, the objective change which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
is made in the common world, is what counts. If we can
get the act done which produces the right sort of changes,
which brings the right kind of result to the various persons
concerned, it is irrelevant and misleading to bother
with the private emotional state of the doer's mind.
Murder would be none the less murder even if the consciousness
of the killer were filled with the most maudlin
sentiments of general philanthropy; the rescue of a
drowning man would be none the less approvable even
if we happened to know that the consciousness of the
rescuer were irritable and grumpy while he was performing
the deed. Acts, not feelings, count, and acts mean
changes actually effected.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><b>Distinction of Intention from Motive.</b>&mdash;The utilitarians
make their point by distinguishing between intention
and motive, attributing moral value exclusively to the
former. According to them, intention is <i>what</i> a man
means to do; motive is the personal frame of mind which
indicates <i>why</i> he means to do it. Intention is the concrete
aim, or purpose; the results which are foreseen and
wanted. Motive is the state of mind which renders these
consequences, rather than others, interesting and attractive.
The following quotations are typical. Bentham
says concerning motives:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If they are good or bad, it is only on account of their
effects: good, on account of their tendency to produce pleasure,
or avert pain: bad, on account of their tendency to produce
pain, or avert pleasure. Now the case is, that from one
and the same motive, and from every kind of motive, may
proceed actions that are good, others that are bad, and others
that are indifferent."</p></div>

<p>Consequently the question of motive is totally irrelevant.
He goes on to give a long series of illustrations, from
which we select one:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"1. A boy, in order to divert himself, reads an inspiring book;
the motive is accounted, perhaps, a good one: at any rate, not
a bad one. 2. He sets his top a-spinning: the motive is
deemed at any rate not a bad one. 3. He sets loose a mad ox
among a crowd: his motive is now, perhaps, termed an
abominable one. Yet in all three cases the motive may be the
very same: it may be neither more nor less than curiosity."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Mill writes to the following effect: "The morality of the action
depends entirely upon the <i>intention</i>&mdash;&mdash;that is, upon <i>what</i>
the agent wills to do. But the motive, that is, the feeling
which made him will so to do, when it makes no difference in
the act, makes none in the morality."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p></div>

<p>Now if motives were merely inert feelings or bare states
of consciousness happening to fill a person's mind apart
from his desires and his ideas, they certainly would not
modify his acts, and we should be compelled to admit the
correctness of this position. But Mill gives the whole
case away when he says that the motive which makes a
man will something, "<i>when it makes no difference in the
act</i>," makes none in its morality. Every motive does
make a difference in the act; it makes precisely the difference
between one act and another. It is a contradiction
in terms to speak of the motive as that <i>which
makes a man</i> will to do an act or intend to effect certain
consequences, and then speak of the motive making no
difference to the act! How can that which makes an
intention make no difference to it, and to the act which
proceeds from it?</p>

<p><b>Concrete Identity of Motive and Intention.</b>&mdash;Ordinary
speech uses motive and intention interchangeably. It
says, indifferently, that a man's motive in writing a letter
was to warn the person addressed or was friendliness.
According to Bentham and Mill, only so-called
states of consciousness in which one feels friendly can
be called motive; the object aimed at, the warning of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the person, is intention, not motive. Again ordinary
speech says either that a doctor's intention was to relieve
his patient, or that it was kind and proper, although the
act turned out badly. But the utilitarians would insist
that only the first usage is correct, the latter confounding
intent with motive. In general, such large terms as
ambition, revenge, benevolence, patriotism, justice, avarice,
are used to signify both motives and aims; both
dispositions <i>from</i> which one acts and results <i>for</i> which
one acts. It is the gist of the following discussion that
common speech is essentially correct in this interchangeable
use of intention and motive. The same set of real
facts, <i>the entire voluntary act</i>, is pointed to by both
terms.</p>

<p><b>Ambiguity in Term "Feelings."</b>&mdash;There is a certain
ambiguity in the term "feelings" as employed by Mill
and Bentham. It may mean feelings apart from ideas,
blind and vague mental states unenlightened by thought,
propelling and impelling tendencies undirected by either
memory or anticipation. Feelings then mean sheer instincts
or impulses. In this sense, they are, as Bentham
claims, without moral quality. But also in this sense
there are no intentions with which motives may be contrasted.
So far as an infant or an insane person is impelled
by some blind impulsive tendency, he foresees nothing,
has no object in view, means nothing, in his act; he
acts without premeditation and intention. "Curiosity" of
this sort may be the source of acts which are harmful or
useful or indifferent. But no consequences were intelligently
foreseen or deliberately wished for, and hence the
acts in question lie wholly outside the scope of morals, even
according to the utilitarian point of view. Morality is a
matter of intent, and intent there was none.</p>

<p><b>Motive as Intelligent.</b>&mdash;In some cases, then, motives have
no moral quality whatsoever, and, <i>in these cases</i>, it is true
that intention has no moral quality either, because there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
is none. Intention and motive are morally on the same
level, not opposed to one another. But motive means not
only blind feeling, that is, impulse without thought; it
also means a tendency which is aware of its own probable
outcome when carried into effect, and which is interested in
the resulting effect. It is perhaps conceivable that a
child should let loose a bull in a crowd from sheer innocent
curiosity to see what would happen&mdash;just as he might
pour acid on a stone. But if he were a normal child, the
next time the impulse presented itself he would recall
the previous result: the fright, the damage, the injury to
life and limb, and would foresee that similar consequences
are likely to happen if he again performs a like act. He
now has what Bentham and Mill call an intention. Suppose
he again lets loose the bull. Only verbally is motive
now the same that it was before. In fact, curiosity is a
very different thing. If the child is still immature and inexperienced
and unimaginative, we might content ourselves
with saying that his motive is egoistic amusement; but
we may also say it is downright malevolence characteristic
of a criminal. In no case should we call it curiosity.
When foresight enters, intent, purpose enters also, and
with it a change of motive from innocent, because blind,
impulse, to deliberate, and hence to virtuous or blameworthy
interest in effecting a certain result. Intention and motive
are upon the same moral level. Intention is the
<i>outcome</i> foreseen and wanted; motive, this outcome <i>as</i>
foreseen and wanted. But the voluntary act, as such,
is an <i>outcome, forethought and desired</i>, and hence
attempted.</p>

<p>This discussion brings out the positive truth for which
Bentham and Mill stand: <i>viz.</i>, that <i>the moral quality of
any impulse or active tendency can be told only by observing
the sort of consequences to which it leads in actual
practice</i>. As against those who insist that there are certain
feelings in human nature so sacred that they do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
need to be measured or tested by noting the consequences
which flow from them, so sacred that they justify an act
<i>no matter what its results</i>, the utilitarians are right.
It is true, as Bentham says, that if motives are good or
bad it is on account of their effects. Hence we must be
constantly considering the effects of our various half-impulsive,
half-blind, half-conscious, half-unconscious motives,
in order to find out what sort of things they are&mdash;whether
to be approved and encouraged, or disapproved
and checked.</p>

<p><b>Practical Importance of Defining Springs to Action
by Results.</b>&mdash;This truth is of practical as well as of
theoretical significance. Many have been taught that
certain emotions are inherently so good that they are
absolutely the justification of certain acts, so that the
individual is absolved from any attention whatsoever to
results. Instance "charity," or "benevolence." The belief
is engrained that the emotion of pity, of desire
to relieve the sufferings of others, is intrinsically noble
and elevating. Hence it has required much discussion and
teaching to bring home, even partially, the evils of indiscriminate
giving. The fact is that pity, sympathy, apart
from forecast of specific results to be reached by acting
upon it, is a mere psychological reaction, as much so as is
shrinking from suffering, or as is a tendency to run away
from danger; in this blind form it is devoid of any moral
quality whatsoever. Hence to teach that the feeling
is good in itself is to make its mere discharge an end in
itself. This is to overlook the evil consequences in the
way of fraud, laziness, inefficiency, parasitism produced in
others, and of sentimentality, pride, self-complacency produced
in the self. There is no doubt that the effect
of some types of moral training is to induce the belief
that an individual may develop goodness of character
simply by cultivating and keeping uppermost in his consciousness
certain types of feelings, irrespective of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
objective results of the acts they lead to&mdash;one of the
most dangerous forms of hypocrisy and of weakened
moral fiber. The insistence of utilitarianism that we must
become aware of the moral quality of our impulses and
states of mind on the basis of the results they effect, and
must control them&mdash;no matter how "good" they feel&mdash;by
their results, is a fundamental truth of morals.</p>

<p><b>Existence and Influence of Idea of Consequences Depends
upon Disposition.</b>&mdash;But the converse is equally
true. Behind every concrete purpose or aim, as idea
or thought of results, lies something, some passion, instinct,
impulse, habit, interest, which gives it a hold on
the person, which gives it motor and impelling force;
and which confers upon it the capacity to operate as
motive, as spring to action. Otherwise, foreseen consequences
would remain mere intellectual entities which
thought might speculatively contemplate from afar, but
which would never possess weight, influence, power to stir
effort. But we must go further. Not only is some active
tendency in the constitution of the man responsible for
the motive power, whether attractive or otherwise, which
foreseen consequences possess, but it is responsible for the
fact that this rather than that consequence is suggested.
A man of consistently amiable character will not be
likely to have thoughts of cruelty to weigh and to dismiss;
a man of greed will be likely to have thoughts of
personal gain and acquisition constantly present to him.
What an individual is interested in occurs to him; what he
is indifferent to does not present itself in imagination or
lightly slips away. Active tendencies, personal attitudes,
are thus in the end the determining causes of our having
certain intentions in mind, as well as the causes of their
active or moving influence. As Bentham says, motives
<i>make</i> intentions.</p>

<p><b>Influence of Interest on Ideas.</b>&mdash;"Purpose is but the
slave of memory." We can anticipate this or that only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
as from past experience we can construct it. But recall,
re-membering (rearticulation) is selective. We pick out
certain past results, certain formerly experienced results,
and we ignore others. Why? Because of our present
interests. We are interested in this or that, and accordingly
it comes to mind and dwells there; or it fails to
appear in recollection, or if appearing, is quickly dismissed.
It is important that the things from the past, which are
relevant to our present activity, should come promptly to
mind and find fertile lodgment, and character decides how
this happens.</p>

<p>Says James:<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What constitutes the difficulty for a man laboring under
an unwise passion acting as if the passion were unwise?...
The difficulty is mental; it is that of getting the idea of the
wise action to stay before our mind at all. When any strong
emotional state whatever is upon us the tendency is for no
images but such as are congruous with it to come up. If
others by chance offer themselves, they are instantly smothered
and crowded out.... By a sort of self-preserving instinct
which our passion has, it feels that these chill objects
[the thoughts of what is disagreeable to the passion] if they
once but gain a lodgment, will work and work until they have
frozen the very vital spark from out of all our mood....
Passion's cue accordingly is always and everywhere to prevent
their still small voice from being heard at all."</p></div>

<p>This quotation refers to a strong passion. It is important
to note <i>that every interest, every emotion, of
whatever nature or strength, works in precisely the
same way</i>. Upon this hangs the entertaining of memories
and ideas about things.  Hence interest is the central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
factor in the development of any concrete intention, both
as to what it is and as to what it is not&mdash;that is, what
the aim would have been if the emotional attitude had
been different. Given a certain emotional attitude, and
the consequences which are pertinent to it are thought
of, while other and equally probable consequences are ignored.
A man of a truly kindly disposition is sensitive
to, aware of, probable results on other people's welfare;
a cautious person sees consequences with reference to his
own standing; an avaricious man feels results in terms of
the probable increase or decrease of his possessions; and
so on. The intimate relation of interest and attention
forms the inseparable tie of intention, <i>what</i> one will, to
motive, <i>why</i> he so wills. When Bentham says that "Motives
are the causes of intentions," he states the fact, and
also reveals motive as the proper final object of moral
judgment.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. CONDUCT AND CHARACTER</h4>

<p>The discussion enables us to place conduct and character
in relation to each other. Mill, after the passage
already quoted (see above, p. 248), to the effect that motive
makes no difference to the morality of the act, says
it "makes a great difference in our moral estimation of
the <i>agent</i>, especially if it indicates a good or a bad
habitual <i>disposition</i>&mdash;a bent of character from which
useful, or from which hurtful, actions are likely to arise."
To like effect Bentham:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Is there nothing, then," he asks,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> "about a man which can
be termed good or bad, when on such or such an occasion,
he suffers himself to be governed by such and such a motive?
Yes, certainly, his <i>disposition</i>. Now disposition is a
kind of fictitious entity,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> feigned for the convenience of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>discourse, in order to express what there is supposed to be
<i>permanent</i> in a man's frame of mind, where, on such or such
an occasion, he has been influenced by such or such a motive,
to engage in an act, which, as it appeared to him, was of
such or such a tendency." He then goes on to say that disposition
is good or bad according to its effects. "A man is
said to be of a mischievous<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> disposition, when by the influence
of no matter what motives, he is <i>presumed</i> to be more apt
to engage, or form intentions of engaging, in acts which
are <i>apparently</i> of a pernicious tendency than in such as are
apparently of a beneficial tendency: of a meritorious or
beneficent disposition in the opposite case."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> And again:
"It is evident that the nature of a man's disposition must
depend upon the nature of the motives he is apt to be influenced
by; in other words, upon the degree of his sensibility
to the force of such and such motives. For his disposition
is, as it were, the sum of his intentions.... Now,
intentions, like everything else, are produced by the things
that are their causes: <i>and the causes of intentions are
motives</i>. If, on any occasion, a man forms either a good or
a bad intention, it must be by the influence of some
motive."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p></div>

<p><b>R&ocirc;le of Character.</b>&mdash;Here we have an explicit recognition
of the fundamental r&ocirc;le of character in the moral life;
and also of why it is important. Character is that body
of active tendencies and interests in the individual which
make him open, ready, warm to certain aims, and callous,
cold, blind to others, and which accordingly habitually
tend to make him acutely aware of and favorable to certain
sorts of consequences, and ignorant of or hostile to
other consequences. A selfish man need not consciously
think a great deal of himself, nor need he be one who,
after deliberately weighing his own claims and others'
claims, consciously and persistently chooses the former.
The number of persons who after facing the entire situation,
would still be anti-social enough deliberately to sacrifice
the welfare of others is probably small. But a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
will have a selfish and egoistic character who, irrespective
of any such conscious balancing of his own and others' welfare,
is habitually more accessible to the thought of those
consequences which affect himself than he is to those which
bear upon others. It is not so much that <i>after</i> thinking of
the effect upon others he declines to give these thoughts any
weight, as that he habitually fails to think at all, or to
think in a vivid and complete way, of the interests of
others. As we say, he does not care; he does not consider,
or regard, others.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><b>Partial and Complete Intent.</b>&mdash;To Mill's statement that
morality depends on intention not upon motive, a critic
objected that on this basis a tyrant's act in saving a man
from drowning would be good&mdash;the intent being rescue of
life&mdash;although his motive was abominable, namely cruelty,
for it was the reservation of the man for death by torture.
Mill's reply is significant. Not so, he answered; there
is in this case a difference of intention, not merely of motive.
The rescue was not the whole act, but "only the
necessary first step of an act." This answer will be found
to apply to every act in which a superficial analysis would
seem to make intent different in its moral significance from
motive. Take into account the remote consequences in
view as well as the near, and the seeming discrepancy disappears.
The intent of rescuing a man and the motive of
cruelty are both descriptions of the same act, the same
moral reality; the difference lying not in the fact, but in
the point of view from which it is named. Now there is
in every one a tendency to fix in his mind only a part of
the probable consequences of his deed; the part which is
most innocent, upon which a favorable construction may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
most easily be put, or which is temporarily most agreeable
to contemplate. Thus the person concentrates his thought,
his forecast of consequences upon external and indifferent
matters, upon distribution of commodities, increase of
money or material resources, and upon positively valuable
results, at the expense of other changes&mdash;&mdash;changes for the
worse in his disposition and in the well-being and freedom
of others. Thus he causes to stand out in strong light
all of those consequences of his activity which are beneficial
and right, and dismisses those of another nature
to the dim recesses of consciousness, so they will not
trouble him with scruples about the proper character of
his act. Since consequences are usually more or less
mixed, such half-conscious, half-unconscious, half-voluntary,
half-instinctive selection easily becomes a habit.
Then the individual excuses himself with reference to the
actual bad results of his behavior on the ground that
he "meant well," his "intention was good"! Common
sense disposes of this evasion by recognizing the
reality of "willing." We say a man is "willing" to
have things happen when, in spite of the fact that
in and of themselves they are objectionable and hence
would not be willed in their isolation, they are consented to,
because they are bound up with something else the person
wants. And to be "willing" to have the harm follow is
really to will it. <i>The agent intends or wills all those consequences
which his prevailing motive or character makes
him willing under the circumstances to accept or tolerate.</i></p>

<p>Exactly the same point comes out from the side of
motive. Motives are complex and "mixed"; ultimately
the motive to an act is that <i>entire</i> character of an
agent on account of which one alternative set of possible
results appeal to him and stir him. Such motives as pure
benevolence, avarice, gratitude, revenge, are abstractions;
we name the motive from the <i>general trend of the issue</i>,
ignoring contributing and indirect causes. All <i>assigned</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
motives are more or less <i>post-mortem</i> affairs. No <i>actuating</i>
motive is ever as simple as reflection afterwards makes
it. But the justification of the simplification is that it
brings to light some factor which needs further attention.
No one can read his own motives, much less those of
another, with perfect accuracy;&mdash;though the more sincere
and transparent the character the more feasible is the
reading. Motives which are active in the depths of
character present themselves only obscurely and subconsciously.
Now if one has been trained to think that
motive apart from intention, apart from view of consequences
flowing from an act, is the source and justification
of its morality, a false and perverse turn is almost sure to
be given to his judgment. Such a person fosters and
keeps uppermost in the focus of his perceptions certain
states of feeling, certain emotions which he has been
taught are good; and then excuses his act, in face of bad
consequences, on the ground that it sprang from a good
motive. Selfish persons are always being "misunderstood."
Thus a man of naturally buoyant and amiable disposition
may unconsciously learn to cultivate superficially certain
emotions of "good-feeling" to others, and yet act in ways
which, judged by consequences that the man might have
foreseen if he had chosen to, are utterly hostile to the
interests of others. Such a man may feel indignant when
accused of unjust or ungenerous behavior, and calling
others to account for uncharitableness, bear witness in his
own behalf that he never entertained any "feelings" of
unkindness, or any "feelings" except those of benevolence,
towards the individual in question.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Only the habit of
reading "motives" in the light of persistent, thorough, and
minute attention to the consequences which flow from them
can save a man from such moral error.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 4. MORALITY OF ACTS AND OF AGENTS</h4>

<p><b>Subjective and Objective Morality.</b>&mdash;Finally we may
discuss the point at issue with reference to the supposed
distinction between subjective and objective morality&mdash;an
agent may be good and his act bad or <i>vice-versa</i>. Both
of the schools which place moral quality either in attitude
or in content, in motive or intent independently of
each other, agree in making a distinction between the morality
of an act and the morality of the agent&mdash;between
objective and subjective morality.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Thus, as we have seen,
Mill says the motive makes a difference in our moral estimate
of its doer, even when it makes none in our judgment
of his action. It is a common idea that certain acts are
right no matter what the motive of the doer, even when
done by one with a bad disposition in doing them. There
can be no doubt that there is a serious difficulty in the facts
themselves. Men actuated by a harsh and narrow desire
for industrial power or for wealth produce social benefits,
stimulate invention and progress, and raise the level of
social life. Napoleon was doubtless moved by vanity and
vainglory to an extent involving immense disregard of
others' rights. And yet in jurisprudence, civil arrangements,
and education he rendered immense social service.
Again, the "conscientious man" is often guilty of bringing
great evils upon society. His very conviction of his own
rightness may only add to the intense vigor which he puts
into his pernicious acts. Surely, we cannot approve the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
conduct, although we are not entitled morally to condemn
the conscientious doer, who does "the best he knows"&mdash;or
believes.</p>

<p><b>Moral Quality of Doer and Deed Proportionate.</b>&mdash;If
we rule out irrelevant considerations, we find that
we never, without qualification, invert our moral judgments
of doer and deed. So far as we regard Napoleon's
actions as <i>morally</i> good (not merely as happening to effect
certain desirable results) we give Napoleon credit
for interest in bringing about those results, <i>and in so far
forth</i>, call him good. Character, like conduct, is a highly
complex thing. No human being is all good or all bad.
Even if we were sure that Napoleon was an evil-minded
man, our judgment is of him as evil <i>upon the whole</i>. Only
if we suppose him to be bad and only bad all the time is
there the opposition of evil character and good actions.
We may believe that even in what Napoleon did in the way
of legal and civic reform he was actuated by mixed motives&mdash;by
vanity, love of greater, because more centralized,
power, etc. But these interests in and of themselves could
not have effected the results he accomplished. He must have
had some insight into a better condition of affairs, and
this insight evidences an interest in so far good. Moreover,
so far as we judge Napoleon bad as to his character
and motive in these acts, we are entitled to hold that the
actions and also the outward results were also partially
evil. That is, while to some extent, socially beneficial,
they would have been still more so if Napoleon had been
actuated by less self-centred considerations. If his character
had been simpler, more sincere, more straightforward,
then certain evil results, certain offsets to the good
he accomplished, would not have occurred. The mixture
of good and evil in the results and the mixture of good
and evil in the motives are proportionate to each other.
Such is the conclusion when we recognize the complexities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
of character and conduct, and do not allow ourselves to
be imposed upon by a fictitious simplicity of analysis.</p>

<p><b>Summary.</b>&mdash;The first quality which is the object of
judgment primarily resides then in intention: in the consequences
which are foreseen and desired. Ultimately it resides
in that disposition or characteristics of a person
which are responsible for his foreseeing and desiring just
such consequences rather than others. The ground for
judging an act on the basis of consequences not foreseen
is that the powers of a man are not fixed, but capable of
modification and redirection. It is only through taking
into account in <i>subsequent</i> acts consequences of <i>prior</i> acts
not intended in those prior acts that the agent learns the
fuller significance of his own power and thus of himself.
Every builder builds other than he knows, whether better
or worse. In no case, can he foresee all the consequences
of his acts.</p>

<p>In subsequent experience these results, mere by-products
of the original volition, enter in. "Outer" and non-moral
for the original act, they are within subsequent
voluntary activity, because they influence desire and
make foresight more accurate in detail and more extensive
in range. This translation of consequences once
wholly unforeseeable into consequences which have to be
taken in account is at its maximum in the change of impulsive
into intelligent action. But there is no act so intelligent
that its actual consequences do not run beyond its
foreseen ones, and thus necessitate a subsequent revision of
intention. Thus the distinction of "inner" and "outer" is
one involved in the <i>growth of character and conduct</i>. Only
if character were not in process of change, only if conduct
were a fixed because isolated thing, should we have that
separation of the inner and the outer which underlies alike
the Kantian and the utilitarian theories. In truth, there
is no separation, but only a contrast of the different levels
of desire and forethought of earlier and later activities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
The great need of the moral agent is thus a character
which will make him as open, as accessible as possible, to the
recognition of the consequences of his behavior.</p>

HAPPINESS AND CONDUCT: THE GOOD AND
DESIRE</h2>


<p>We have reached a conclusion as to our first inquiry
(p. 201), and have decided that the appropriate subject-matter
of moral judgment is the disposition of the person
as manifested in the tendencies which cause certain consequences,
rather than others, to be considered and esteemed&mdash;foreseen
and desired. Disposition, motive, intent
are then judged good or bad according to the consequences
they tend to produce. But what are the consequences by
which we determine anything to be good or bad? We turn
from the locus or residence of the distinctions of good and
bad to the nature of the distinctions themselves. What
do good and bad mean as terms of voluntary behavior?</p>

<p><b>Happiness and Misery as the Good and Bad.</b>&mdash;There is
one answer to this question which is at once so simple and
so comprehensive that it has always been professed by some
representative ethical theory: the good is happiness, well-being,
pleasure; the bad is misery, woe, pain.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The agreeableness
or disagreeableness attending consequences differentiates
them into good and bad; and it is because some
deeds are found to lead to pleasure, while others lead to
pain, that they are adjudged virtuous or vicious. In its
modern form, this theory is known as utilitarianism. Bentham
has given it a sweeping and clear formulation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two
sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone
to point out what we ought to do as well as to determine what
we shall do. On the one hand, the standard of right and
wrong, on the other chain of causes and effects, are fastened
to their throne."</p>

<p>"Strictly speaking nothing can be said to be good or bad
but either in itself, which is the case only with pain or pleasure;
or on account of its effects, which is the case only with
things that are the cause or preventive of pain or pleasure."
Again: "By the principle of utility is meant that principle
which approves or disapproves of every action whatever according
to the tendency it appears to have to augment or
diminish the happiness of the party whose interests are in
question."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Once more: "The greatest happiness of all those
whose interest is in question is the right and proper, and the
only right and proper and universally desirable end of human
action." "Only on the basis of this principle do the words
'right and wrong' and 'ought' have an intelligent meaning as
applied to actions; otherwise they have not."</p></div>

<p>This last statement need not mean, however, that all judgments
of right and wrong are as matter of fact derived
from a consideration of the results of action in the way of
pain and pleasure, but that upon this ground alone <i>should</i>
our judgments be formed, since upon this basis alone can
they be justified.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p><b>Axiomatic Identification of Good with Happiness.</b>&mdash;The
principle that happiness is the ultimate aim of human
action and the ultimate standard of the moral value of
that action is generally regarded by the utilitarians as
axiomatic and not susceptible of proof. As Bentham says,
"that which is used to prove everything else cannot itself
be proved. A chain of proofs must have their commence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>ment
somewhere." So Bain says (<i>Moral Science</i>, p. 27),
"Now there can be no proof offered for the position that
happiness is the proper end of all human procedures, the
criterion of all right conduct. It is an ultimate or final
assumption to be tested by reference to the individual judgments
of mankind." Thus also Mill (<i>Utilitarianism</i>):
"The only proof capable of being given that an object
is visible is that people actually see it. In like manner
the sole proof that it is possible to produce that anything
is desirable is that people do actually desire it."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><b>Extreme Opposition to Happiness Theory.</b>&mdash;In striking
contrast to this view of the self-evident character
of happiness as the all-desirable, is the view of those to
whom it is equally self-evident that to make pleasure the
end of action is destructive of all morality. Carlyle is an
interesting illustration of a violent reaction against utilitarianism.
His more moderate characterization of it is
"mechanical profit and loss" theory. It is "an upholstery
and cookery conception of morals." It never gets above
the level of considerations of comfort and expediency.
More vehemently, it is a "pig philosophy" which regards
the universe as a "swine trough" in which virtue is thought
of as the attainment of the maximum possible quantity of
"pig's wash." Again, apostrophizing man, he says: "Art
thou nothing else than a Vulture that flies through the Universe
seeking after Somewhat to eat; shrieking dolefully because
Carrion enough is not given thee?" Of the attempt
to make general happiness the end, he says it proposes the
problem of "Given a world of Knaves, to produce honesty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
from their united action," the term "knave" referring to
the individualistic self-seeking character of pleasure and
"honesty" to the social outcome desired. As a political
theory, he thought that utilitarianism subordinated justice
to benevolence, and in that light he referred to it as
a "universal syllabub of philanthrophic twaddle."</p>

<p><b>Ambiguity in Notion of Happiness.</b>&mdash;If to some it is
self-evident that happiness is the aim of action, and success
in achieving it the test both of the act and the disposition
from which it proceeds; while to others it is equally obvious
that such a view means immorality or at least a base
and sordid morality, it is reasonable to suppose that the
"happiness" does not mean the same to both parties; that
there is some fundamental ambiguity in the notion.</p>

<p><b>Source of Ambiguity.</b>&mdash;The nature of this ambiguity
may be inferred from the fact that Bentham himself&mdash;and
in this he is typical of all the utilitarians&mdash;combines
in his statement two aspects of happiness, or two views of
pleasure. He says it is for pleasure and pain alone to
"<i>point out what we ought to do</i>," that they are the only
basis upon which our judgments of right and wrong <i>ought</i>
to be formed, or upon which they can be justified. Other
things <i>may</i> be taken as pointing out what we ought to do;
other standards of judgment&mdash;caprice, sympathy, dogma&mdash;are
employed. But they are not the right and proper
ones. Consideration of consequences of the act in the way
of effect upon the happiness and misery of all concerned,
furnishes the only proper way of regulating the formation
of right ends. A certain happiness, that of results,
is the standard. But this presupposes that, in any case
there is some end, and one which may be improper because
not in accord with the standard. Yet this end also must be
pleasure. Pleasure and pain "determine what we <i>shall</i>
do," whether we act for the maximum of pleasures or not.
The "chain of causes" as well as the "standard of right"
is fastened to them. We act for pleasure, even when we do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
not act for the pleasures for which we ought to act.
Pleasure or happiness thus appears in a double r&ocirc;le. Only
in the case of <i>right</i> ends, is it the same happiness which
serves as a moving spring and as standard of judgment.
In other cases, it is one pleasure which is the end in view,
and another pleasure, one not in view, or at least not influencing
action, which measures rightness. The essence,
so to speak, of a wrong act is precisely that the pleasures
which produce it are not these pleasures which measure
its goodness; the agent is not moved to act by those pleasures
and pains which as consequences settle its moral value,
but by some pleasure or pain which happens to be strongly
felt at the moment of action.</p>

<p><b>Two Sorts of Good.</b>&mdash;Thus, even from Bentham's point
of view, there is a difference between real and apparent
happiness, between the good which moves to action and
that which, being the standard, should move. If the end
of <i>all</i> acts is happiness and yet we require a consideration
of results to show us <i>what</i> happiness we are justified in
seeking, then "happiness" is in a highly ambiguous position.
While from one standpoint, it furnishes the standard
of right and wrong; from another, it furnishes the
moving spring of all wrong action; it is that which so
solicits and tempts us that we fail to employ the right
standard for the regulation of our action, and hence go
astray. It seems to some (as to Carlyle) that this distinction
is so fundamental that it is absurd to say that one
and the same thing can be the standard of all right action
and the moving spring of all wrong action. Hence they
insist upon the fundamental opposition of virtue and happiness.</p>

<p>Moreover, from Bentham's own point of view, there is
a difference between the good which <i>first</i> presents itself,
which <i>first</i> stirs desire and solicits to action, and the good
which being formed <i>after and upon the basis of consideration
of consequences</i>, is the <i>right</i> good. In calling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
latter the <i>right</i>, we mean that it has authority over the
end which first appears; and hence has supreme claim
over action. So it is again evident that we are using happiness
in two quite different senses; so that if we call the
first end that presents itself happiness, the right end will
be something else; or if we call the consequences which
measure the worth of the act happiness, then the first end
ought to be called something else. If happiness is the
<i>natural</i> end of all desire and endeavor, it is absurd to say
that the same happiness ought to be the end. If all objects
fall to the ground any way, we do not say they
ought to fall. If all our acts are moved any way by
pleasure and pain, this fact, just because it applies
equally to all acts, throws no lights upon the rightness
or wrongness of any one of them. Or, on the other
hand, if that for which we <i>should</i> act is a kind of happiness
which involves full consideration of consequences,
it is misleading to call that happiness from which we act
"blindly" or without proper forethought.</p>

<p>If happiness is to be the same as the moral good, it
must be after the right kind of happiness has been distinguished;
namely, that which commends itself after adequate
reflection. Our criticism of Bentham will be directed
to showing that, so far as he conceives of happiness as
simply a sum of pleasures alike in quality, but differing
only in quantity, he cannot make this distinction. As an
early critic (Hazlitt) of Bentham said: "Pleasure is that
which is so in itself. Good is that which approves itself
on reflection, or the <i>idea</i> of which is a source of satisfaction.
All pleasure is not, therefore (morally speaking),
equally a good; for all pleasure does not equally bear reflecting
upon." We shall further try to show that the
reason for Bentham's conceiving happiness as simply a
sum of pleasures is that he falls into the error already
discussed, of separating consequences from the disposition
and capacities or active tendencies of the agent. And that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
when we correct this error, the proper meaning of happiness
turns out to be the satisfaction, realization, or fulfillment
of some <i>purpose and power of the agent</i>. Thus
we can distinguish between the false and unsatisfactory
happiness found in the expression of a more or less isolated
and superficial tendency of the self, and the true or
genuine good found in the adequate fulfillment of a fundamental
and fully related capacity. We shall first take
up the discussion under the heads just brought out: I.
Happiness <i>as the Natural End or Object of Desire</i>; II.
Happiness <i>as Standard of Judgment</i>.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. THE OBJECT OF DESIRE</h4>

<p><b>Hedonistic Theory of Desire.</b>&mdash;That phase of utilitarianism
which holds that the object of desire is pleasure,
is termed hedonism, or sometimes psychological hedonism
to distinguish it from ethical hedonism, the theory that
pleasure is the standard for judging acts. The fundamental
fallacy of psychological hedonism has been well
stated by Green to be supposing that a desire can be
aroused or created by the anticipation of its own satisfaction&mdash;i.e.,
in supposing that the idea of the pleasure of
exercise arouses desire for it, when in fact the idea of
exercise is pleasant only if there be already some desire for
it (Green, <i>Prolegomena to Ethics</i>, p. 168). Given a desire
already in existence, the idea of an object which is thought
of as satisfying that desire will always arouse pleasure, or
be thought of as pleasurable. But hedonism fails to consider
the radical difference between an object's arousing
pleasure, because it is regarded as satisfying desire, and
the thought of a pleasure arousing a desire:&mdash;although the
feeling of agreeableness may intensify the movement towards
the object. A hungry man thinks of a beefsteak as
that which would satisfy his appetite; his thought is at
once clothed with an agreeable tone and the conscious force<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
of the appetite is correspondingly intensified; the miser
thinks of gold in a similar way; the benevolent of an act
of charity, etc. But in each case the presence of the pleasurable
element is dependent upon the thought of an object
which is not pleasure&mdash;the beefsteak, the gold. The
thought of the object <i>precedes</i> the pleasure and excites
it because it is felt to promise the satisfaction of a desire.</p>

<p><b>Pleasure is the Felt Concomitant of Imagining a Desire
Realized in Its Appropriate Object.</b>&mdash;The object of
desire is not pleasure, but some object is pleasurable because
it is the congenial terminus of desire. The pleasure
felt is a <i>present</i> pleasure, the pleasure which <i>now</i> accompanies
the idea of the satisfied desire. It intensifies the desire
in its present character, through opposition to the disagreeable
tone of the experienced lack and want.</p>

<p><b>1. Pleasures and Original Appetites.</b>&mdash;Biological instincts
and appetites exist not for the sake of furnishing
pleasure, but as activities needed to maintain life&mdash;the life
of the individual and the species. Their adequate fulfillment
is attended with pleasure. Such is the undoubted biological
fact. Now if the animal be gifted with memory and
anticipation, this complicates the process, but does not
change its nature. The animal in feeling hungry may now
consciously anticipate the getting of food and may feel
pleasure in the idea of food. The pleasure henceforth attends
not merely upon attained satisfaction of appetite,
but also upon appetite prior to satisfaction, so far as that
anticipates its future satisfaction. But desire is still for
the object, for the food. If the desire is healthy, it will
not depend for its origin upon the recollection of a prior
pleasure; the animal does not happen to recall that it got
pleasure from food and thus arouse a desire for more food.
The desire springs up naturally from the state of the organism.
Only a jaded and unhealthy appetite has to
whip itself up by recalling previous pleasures. But if
there are many obstacles and discouragements in the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of getting the object which satisfies want, the anticipation
of pleasure in its fulfillment may normally intensify the
putting forth of energy, may give an extra re&euml;nforcement
to flagging effort. In this way, the anticipation of pleasure
has a normal place in the effective direction of activities.
But in any case, the desire and its own object are
primary; the pleasure is secondary.</p>

<p><b>2. Pleasure and Acquired Desires.</b>&mdash;The same point
comes out even more clearly when we take into account
the so-called higher desires and sentiments&mdash;those which
usually enter into distinctively moral questions. In these
cases it is no longer a matter of the original instincts
and appetites of the organism. Their place is taken by
acquired habits and dispositions. The object of a benevolent
desire is the supplying of another's lack, or the
increase of his good. The pleasure which accompanies
the doing of a kindness to others is not the object, for the
individual thinks of the kindly act as pleasure-giving
only because he already has a benevolent character which
naturally expresses itself in amiable desires. So far as
he is not benevolent, the act will appear repulsive rather
than attractive to him; and if it is done, it will be not from
a benevolent desire, but from a cowardly or an avaricious
desire, the pleasure in that case attending the thought
of some other objective consequence, such as escaping unpopularity.
In like manner, the aim to behave honestly,
or to obey the civil law, or to love one's country, leads
to dwelling upon the acts and objects in which these desires
and intents may be fulfilled; and those objects which
are thought of as affording fulfillment are necessarily put
in a favorable and attractive light&mdash;they are regarded as
sources of happiness. To a patriot the thought even of
possible death may arouse a glow of satisfaction as he
thinks of this act as strengthening his country's existence.
But to suppose that this attendant pleasure is the aim
and object of desire is to put the cart before the horse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p><b>3. Happiness and Desire.</b>&mdash;All men, then, may be said
to desire happiness. But this happiness is not dependent
upon prior experiences of pleasure, which, coming up in
memory, arouse desire and rivet attention upon themselves.
To say that the desire of a man is for happiness is only
to say that happiness comes in the fulfillment of desire,
the desires arising on their own account as expressions of
a state of lack or incompletion in which the person finds
himself. Happiness thus conceived <i>is dependent upon the
nature of desire and varies with it, while desire varies
with the type of character</i>. If the desire is the desire
of an honest man, then the prosperous execution of some
honorable intent, the payment of a debt, the adequate termination
of a trust, is conceived as happiness, as good.
If it be the desire of a profligate, then entering upon
the riotous course of living now made possible by inheritance
of property is taken as happiness&mdash;the one consummation
greatly to be wished. If we know what any person
really finds desirable, what he stakes his happiness upon,
we can read his nature. In happiness, as the anticipation
of the satisfaction of desire, there is, therefore, no sure or
unambiguous quality; for it may be a token of good or of
bad character, according to the sort of object which appeals
to the person. The present joy found in the idea of
the completion of a purpose cannot be the object of desire,
for we desire only things absent. But the joy is a mark of
the congruity or harmony of the thought of the object,
whatever it be&mdash;health, dissipation, miserliness, prodigality,
conquest, helpfulness&mdash;with the character of the agent.
It is an evidence of the moving force, the influence, the
weight, of the conceived end; it registers the extent in
which the end is not a mere intellectual abstraction, but is a
<i>motive</i> (see p. 252). But the moral worth of this motive
depends upon the character of the end in which the person
finds his satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>4. Confusion of Future and Present Pleasure.</b>&mdash;It is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
confusion of <i>present</i> pleasure, attendant upon the thought
of an object as satisfying desire, with the pleasure that
<i>will come when the desire is satisfied</i>, that accounts for
the persistence of the idea that pleasure is the object of
desire. The fact that the object of desire is <i>now</i> pleasurable
is distorted into the statement that we <i>seek</i> for an
absent pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> A good illustration of the confusion is
seen in the following quotation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The love of happiness must express the sole possible motive
of Judas Iscariot and of his Master; it must explain the
conduct of Stylites on his pillar or Tiberius at Capr&aelig; or
&agrave; Kempis in his cell or of Nelson in the cockpit of the Victory.
It must be equally good for saints and martyrs, heroes,
cowards, debauch&eacute;s, ascetics, mystics, misers, prodigals, men,
women and babes in arms" (Leslie Stephen, <i>Science of
Ethics</i>, p. 44).</p></div>

<p>This statement is true, as we have just seen, in the sense
that different persons find different things good in accordance
with their different characters or habitually
dominant purposes; that each finds his happiness in whatever
he most sets his affections upon. Where a man's heart
is, there will his treasure be also, and where that is which
a man regards as treasure, there also is the heart. A
man's character is revealed by the objects which make him
happy, whether anticipated or realized.</p>

<p><b>Our Ends are Our Happiness, Not a Means to It.</b>&mdash;But
the fallacy is in the words "love of happiness." They
suggest that all alike are seeking for some one and the
same thing, some one thing labeled "happiness," identical
in all cases, differing in the way they look for it&mdash;that
saints and martyrs, heroes and cowards, all have
just the same objective goal in view&mdash;if they only knew
it! In so far as it is true that there are certain funda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>mental
conditions of the self which have to be satisfied in
order that there shall be a <i>true self and a true satisfaction</i>,
happiness is the same for all, and is the ultimate
good of all. But this holds only of the <i>standard</i> of happiness
which makes any particular conception of happiness
right or wrong, not to the conceptions actually entertained.
To say that all are consciously and deliberately after
the same happiness is to pervert the facts. Happiness as
standard means the genuine fulfillment of whatever is
necessary to the development and integrity of the self. In
this sense, it is what men <i>ought</i> to desire; it is what they
do desire so far as they understand themselves and the
conditions of their satisfaction. But as natural or psychological
end, it means that in which a man happens at
a given time to find delectation, depending upon his uppermost
wishes and strongest habits. Hence the objection
which almost every one, including the hedonists, feels to
the statement that happiness is the conscious aim of conduct.
It suggests that the objects at which we ordinarily
aim are not sought for themselves, but for some ulterior
gratification to ourselves. In reality these ends, so far
as they correspond to our capacity and intention, <i>are</i> our
happiness. All men love happiness&mdash;yes, in the sense
that, having desires, they are interested in the objects in
which the desires may be realized, no matter whether they
are worthy or degraded. No; if by this be meant that
happiness is something other than and beyond the conditions
in which the powers of the person are brought out,
and made effective; no, or if it means that all love that
which really will bring happiness.</p>

<p><b>Necessity for Standard.</b>&mdash;As many sorts of character,
so many sorts of things regarded as satisfactory, as constitutive
of good. Not all anticipations when realized
are what they were expected to be. The good in prospect
may be apples of Sodom, dust and ashes, in attainment.
Hence some ends, some forms of happiness, are regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
as unworthy, not as "real" or "true." While they appeared
to be happiness during the expectancy of desire, they are
not approved as such in later reflection. Hence the demand
for some standard good or happiness by which
the individual may regulate the formation of his desires
and purposes so that the present and the permanent
good, the good in desire and in reflection, will coincide&mdash;so
that the individual will find that to be satisfactory in
his present view which will also permanently satisfy him.
From happiness as a conceived good we turn to happiness
as <i>rightly</i> conceived good; from happiness as result to happiness
as standard. As before, we begin with the narrower
utilitarian conception.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. THE CONCEPTION OF HAPPINESS AS A STANDARD</h4>

<p><b>Utilitarian Method.</b>&mdash;Hedonism means that pleasure is
the end of human action, because the end of desire. Utilitarianism
or universalistic hedonism holds that the pleasure
of all affected is the standard for judging the worth
of action,&mdash;not that conduciveness to happiness is the sole
measure actually employed by mankind for judging moral
worth, but that it is the sole standard that should be
employed. Many other tests may actually be used, sympathy,
prejudice, convention, caprice, etc., but "utility"
is the one which will enable a person to judge <i>truly</i> what
is right or wrong in any proposed course of action. The
method laid down by Bentham is as follows: Every proposed
act is to be viewed with reference to its probable
consequences in (a) <i>intensity</i> of pleasure and pains; (b)
their duration; (c) their certainty or uncertainty; (d)
their nearness or remoteness; (e) their fecundity&mdash;i.e.,
the tendency of a pleasure to be followed by others, or
a pain by other pains; (f) their <i>purity</i>&mdash;i.e., the tendency
of a pleasure to be followed by pains and <i>vice versa</i>; (g)
their extent, that is, the number or range of persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
whose happiness is affected&mdash;with reference to whose
pleasures and pains each one of the first six items ought
also in strictness to be calculated! Then sum up all the
pleasures which stand to the credit side of the account;
add the pains which are the debit items, or liabilities, on
the other; then take their algebraic sum, and "the balance
of it on the side of pleasure will be the good tendency of
the act upon the whole."</p>

<p><b>Circle in Method.</b>&mdash;Bentham's argument depends wholly
upon the possibility of both foreseeing and accurately
measuring the amount of future pleasures and pains that
will follow from the intention if it is carried into effect,
and of being able to find their algebraic sum. Our examination
will be directed to showing that we have here
the same fallacy that we have just discussed; and that
Bentham argues in a circle. For the argument purports
to measure present disposition or intent by summing up
future units of pleasure or pain; but there is no way
of estimating amounts of future satisfaction, the relative
intensity and weight of future possible pain and pleasure
experiences, except upon the basis of present tendencies,
the habitual aims and interests, of the person. (1)
The only way to estimate the relative amount (bulk, intensity,
etc.) of a future "lot" of pleasure or pain, is by
seeing how agreeable to <i>present</i> disposition are certain
anticipated consequences, themselves not pleasures or pains
at all. (2) The only basis upon which we can be sure
that there is a <i>right</i> estimate of future satisfactions, is
that we already have a good character as a basis and
organ for forming judgment.</p>

<p><b>(1) How Pleasures and Pains are Measured.</b>&mdash;If we
keep strictly to Bentham's own conception of pleasures
as isolated entities, all just alike in quality, but differing
in quantity&mdash;in the two dimensions of intensity and
duration&mdash;the scheme he recommends is simply impossible.
What does it mean to say that one pleasure, as an ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>ternal
and future fact, is equal to another? What practical
sense is there in the notion that a pain may be found
which is exactly equal to a pleasure, so that it may just
offset it or reduce it to zero? How can one weigh the
amount of pain in a jumping and long-continued toothache
against, say, the pleasure of some charitable deed
performed under conditions which may bring on the toothache?
What relevancy has the quantitative comparison
to a judgment of moral worth? How many units of
pleasure are contained in the fulfillment of the intention
to go to war for one's country? How many in the fulfillment
of the intention to remain at home with one's
family and secure profitable contracts from the government?
How shall the pains involved in each set be detected
and have their exact numerical force assigned them?
How shall one set be measured over against the other?
If a man is already a patriot, one set of consequences
comes into view and has weight; if one is already a coward
and a money-grubber, another set of consequences looms up
and its value is measured on a rule of very different scale.</p>

<p><b>Present Congeniality to Character Measures Importance.</b>&mdash;When
we analyze what occurs, we find that this
process of comparing future possible satisfactions, to see
which is the greater, takes place on exactly the opposite
basis from that set forth by Bentham. We do not compare
results in the way of fixed amounts of pleasures and
pains, but we compare <i>objective</i> results, changes to be
effected in ourselves, in others, in the whole social situation;
during this comparison desires and aversions take
more definite form and strength, so that we find the idea
of one result more agreeable, more harmonious, to our
present character than another. <i>Then</i> we say it is more
satisfying, it affords more pleasure than another. The
satisfaction <i>now</i> aroused in the mind at the thought of
getting even with an enemy may be stronger than the painfulness
of the thought of the harm or loss that will come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
to him or than the thought of danger itself,&mdash;then the
pleasures to follow from vengeance are esteemed more numerous,
stronger, more lasting, etc., than those which
would follow from abstinence. Or, to say that satisfactions
are about equal means that we are <i>now</i> at a loss
to choose between them. But we are not at a loss to choose
because certain future pains and pleasures present themselves
in and of themselves as fixed amounts irrespective
of our own wishes, habits, and plans of life. Similarly
we may speak of satisfactions being added to one another
and the total sum increased; or of dissatisfaction coming
in as offsets and reducing the amount of satisfaction. But
this does not mean that pains and pleasures which we expect
to arrive in the future are added and subtracted&mdash;what
intelligible meaning can such a phrase possess? It
means that as we think first of this result and then of
another, the present happiness found in the anticipation
of one is increased by the anticipation of the other; or that
the results are so incompatible that the present satisfaction,
instead of swelling and expanding as from one
thought to another, is chilled and lessened. Thus we might
find the thought of revenge sweet (and thus give a high
valuation to the units of pleasure to result from it), but
be checked by the thought of the meanness of the act, or
of how we would feel if some one else, whose good opinion
we highly esteem, should hear of it.</p>

<p><b>(2) Congeniality to a Good Character the Right Measure.</b>&mdash;The
net outcome of this discussion is that the practical
value of our acts is defined to us at any given time
by the satisfaction, or displeasure, we take in the ideas of
changes we foresee in case the act takes place. The present
happiness or distaste, depending upon the harmony between
the idea in question and the character, defines for
us the value of the future consequences: which is the
reverse of saying that a calculation of future pains and
pleasures determines for us the value of the act and char<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>acter.
But this applies to any end as it happens to arise,
not to the end as we ought to form it; we are still without
a standard. What has been said applies to the criminal
as well as to the saint; to the miser and the prodigal
and the wisely generous alike. The idea of a certain result
warms the heart of each, his heart being what it is.
The assassin would not be one if the thought of a murder
had not been entertained by him and if the thought had
not been liked and welcomed&mdash;made at home. Only upon
the supposition that character is already good can we
trust judgment, first, to foresee all the consequences that
should be foreseen; and, secondly, to respond to each foreseen
consequence with the right emotional stamp of like
and dislike, pleasure and pain. The Greeks said it is the
object of a moral education to see that the individual finds
his pleasure in the thought of noble ends and finds his pain
in the contemplation of base ends. Again, as Aristotle
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The good man wills the real object of intent, but what the
bad man desires may be anything; just as physically those
in good condition want things that are wholesome, while the
diseased may take anything to be healthful; for the good man
judges correctly" (<i>Ethics</i>, Book III., 4, 4). And again:
"The good man is apt to go right about pleasure, and the bad
man is apt to go wrong" (Book II., 3, 7), and, finally, "It
is only to the good man that the good presents itself as good,
for vice perverts us and causes us to err about the principle
of action" (Book III., 12, 10).</p></div>

<p><b>Principle of Quality of Pleasure as Criterion.</b>&mdash;Mill,
still calling himself a utilitarian, reaches substantially the
same result by (a) making the <i>quality</i> of pleasure, not
its bulk or intensity, the standard; and (b) referring differences
in quality to differences in the <i>characters</i> which
experience them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is," he says, "quite compatible with the principle of utility
to recognize the fact that some <i>kinds</i> of pleasure are more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
desirable and more valuable than others. Human beings have
faculties more elevated than the animal appetites, and, when
once made conscious of them, do not regard anything as happiness
that does not include their gratification."</p></div>

<p>The higher the capacity or faculty, the higher in quality
the pleasure of its exercise and fulfillment, irrespective
of bulk. But how do we know which faculty <i>is</i> higher,
and hence what satisfaction is more valuable? By reference
to the experience of the man who has had the best
opportunity to exercise all the powers in question.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any
of the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance
of a beast's pleasure; no intelligent human being would consent
to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus,
no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base,
even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the
dunce or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than
they are with theirs." And again, "It is indisputable that
the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low has the
greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly
endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he
can look for, as the world is constituted, is imperfect.... It
is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied;
better to be a Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And
if the fool or the pig is of a different opinion, it is because
he only knows his own side of the question. The other party
to the comparison knows both sides."</p></div>

<p>The net result of our discussion is, then, (1) that happiness
consists in the fulfillment in their appropriate objects
(or the anticipation of such fulfillment) of the powers
of the self manifested in desires, purposes, efforts; (2)
true happiness consists in the satisfaction of those powers
of the self which are of higher quality; (3) that the man
of good character, the one in whom these high powers are
already active, is the judge, in the concrete, of happiness
and misery. We shall now discuss</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 3. THE CONSTITUTION OF HAPPINESS</h4>

<p>Happiness consists in the agreement, whether anticipated
or realized, of the objective conditions brought about
by our endeavors with our desires and purposes. This conception
of happiness is contrasted with the notion that it
is a sum or collection of separate states of sensation or
feeling.</p>

<p><b>1. One View Separates, while the Other Connects,
Pleasure and Objective Conditions.</b>&mdash;In one case, the
agreeable feeling is a kind of psychical entity, supposed
to be capable of existence by itself and capable of abstraction
from the objective end of action. The pleasant
<i>thing</i> is one thing; the pleasure, another; or, rather, the
<i>pleasant thing</i> must be analyzed into two independent elements,
the pleasure as <i>feeling</i> and the <i>thing</i> with which
it happens to be associated. It is the pleasure alone, <i>when
dissociated</i>, which is the real end of conduct, an object
being at best an external means of securing it. It is the
pleasurable feeling which happens to be <i>associated</i> with
food, with music, with a landscape, that makes it good;
health, art, are not good in themselves. The other view
holds that pleasure has no such existence by itself; that
it is only a name for the <i>pleasant object</i>; that by pleasure
is meant the agreement or congruity which exists between
some capacity of the agent and some objective fact
in which this capacity is realized. It expresses the way
some object meets, fits into, responds to, an activity of
the agent. To say that food is agreeable, means that food
satisfies an organic function. Music is pleasant because
by it certain capacities or demands of the person with respect
to rhythm of hearing are fulfilled; a landscape is
beautiful because it carries to fulfillment the visual possibilities
of the spectator.</p>

<p><b>2. Qualities of Pleasure Vary with Objects, and with
Springs to Action.</b>&mdash;When happiness is conceived as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
aggregate of states of feeling, these are regarded as
homogeneous in quality, differing from one another only
in intensity and duration. Their qualitative differences
are not intrinsic, but are due to the different objects with
which they are associated (as pleasures of hearing, or
vision). Hence they disappear when the pleasure is taken
by itself as an end. But if agreeableness is precisely the
agreeableness or congruousness of some objective condition
with some impulse, habit, or tendency of the agent,
then, of course, pure pleasure is a myth. Any pleasure
is qualitatively unique, being precisely the harmony of
one set of conditions with its appropriate activity. The
pleasure of eating is one thing; the pleasure of hearing
music, another; the pleasure of an amiable act, another;
the pleasure of drunkenness or of anger is still another.
Hence the possibility of absolutely different moral values
attaching to pleasures, according to the type or aspect
of character which they express. But if the good is only
a sum of pleasures, any pleasure, so far as it goes, is as
good as any other&mdash;the pleasure of malignity as good as
the pleasure of kindliness, simply as pleasure. Accordingly
Bentham said, the pleasure of push-pin (a game)
is as good as that of poetry. And as he said again, since
pleasure is the motive of every act, there is no motive
which <i>in itself</i>, and as far as it goes, is not good&mdash;it is
bad only if it turns out in the end to produce more pain
than pleasure. The pleasure of malignant gossip is so
far as it is pleasure a mitigation of the badness of the
act. Not so, if happiness is the experience into which
pleasures enter so far as the tendencies of character
that produce them are approved of. An act may bring
a pleasure and yet that pleasure be no part of happiness,
but rather a blot and blemish. Such would be the
case, for example, with the pleasure which one might take
in an act of charity because one had thereby put himself
in a position superior to that of the recipient. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
good man who caught himself feeling pleasure from this
phase of the act would not regard this pleasure as a
further element of good attained, but as detracting from
his happiness. A pleasure may be accepted or reacted
against. So far as not acquiesced in it is, from the standpoint
of happiness, positively disagreeable. Surrender
to a pleasure, taking it to be one's happiness, is one of
the surest ways of revealing or discovering what sort of
a man one is. On the other hand, the pain which a
miserly man feels in his first acts of generosity may be
welcomed by him as, under the circumstances, an element
in his good, since it is a sign of and factor in the improvement
of character.</p>

<p><b>3. The Unification of Character.</b>&mdash;Happiness as a sum
of pleasures does not afford a basis for unifying or organizing
the various tendencies and capacities of the self.
It makes possible at best only a mechanical compromise
or external adjustment. Take, for example, the satisfaction
attendant upon acting from a benevolent or a malicious
impulse. There can be no question that some
pleasure is found in giving way to either impulse when
it is strongly felt. Now if we regard the pleasure as
a fixed state in itself, and good or happiness as a sum
of such states, the only moral superiority that can attach
to acting benevolently is that, upon the whole, <i>more</i> units
of pleasure come from it than from giving way to the
opposite spring of action. It is simply a question of
greater or less quantity in the long run. Each trait
of character, each act, remains morally independent, cut
off from others. Its only relation to others is that which
arises when its results in the way of units of agreeable
or painful feeling are compared, as to bulk, with analogous
consequences flowing from some other trait, or act. But if
the fundamental thing in happiness is the relation of the
desire and intention of the agent to its own successful outlet,
there is an inherent connection between our different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
tendencies. The satisfaction of one tendency strengthens
itself, and strengthens allied tendencies, while it weakens
others. A man who gives way easily to anger (and finds
gratification in it) against the acts of those whom he
regards as enemies, nourishes unawares a tendency to irritability
in all directions and thus modifies the sources and
nature of all satisfaction. The man who cherishes the satisfaction
he derives from a landscape may increase his
susceptibility to enjoyment from poetry and pictures.</p>

<p><b>The Final Question.</b>&mdash;The final question of happiness,
the question which marks off true and right happiness
from false and wrong gratification, comes to this: Can
there be found ends of action, desirable in themselves,
which re&euml;nforce and expand not only the motives from
which they directly spring, but also the other tendencies
and attitudes which are sources of happiness? Can there be
found powers whose exercise confirms ends which are stable
and weakens and removes objects which occasion only restless,
peevish, or transitory satisfaction, and ultimately
thwart and stunt the growth of happiness? Harmony,
re&euml;nforcement, expansion are the signs of a true or moral
satisfaction. What is the good which while good in direct
enjoyment also brings with it fuller and more continuous
life?</p>

HAPPINESS AND SOCIAL ENDS<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></h2>


<p>In form, the true good is thus an inclusive or expanding
end. In substance, the only end which fulfills these conditions
is the social good. The utilitarian standard is
social consequences. To repeat our earlier quotation from
Bentham (above, p. 264):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The greatest happiness of all those whose interest is in
question is the right and proper, and the only right and
proper and <i>universally desirable</i> end of human action." Mill
says, "To do as you would be done by, and to love your
neighbor as yourself, constitute the ideal perfection of utilitarian
morality." And again: "The happiness which is the
Utilitarian standard of what is right in conduct is not the
agent's own happiness, but that of all concerned; as between
his own happiness and that of others, Utilitarianism requires
him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent
spectator." So Sidgwick (<i>Methods of Ethics</i>, p. 379):
"By Utilitarianism is here meant the ethical theory, first distinctly
formulated by Bentham, that the conduct which under
any given circumstances is externally or objectively right is
that which produces the greatest amount of happiness <i>on the
whole</i>; that is taking into account all whose happiness is
affected by the conduct. It would tend to clearness if we
might call this principle, and the method based upon it, by
some such name as Universalistic hedonism." And finally,
Bain (<i>Emotions and Will</i>, p. 303): "Utility is opposed to the
selfish principle, for, as propounded, it always implies the
good of society generally and the subordination of individual
interests to the general good."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Social Purpose of Utilitarianism.</b>&mdash;Its aim, then, was
the "greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible
number," a democratic, fraternal aim. In the computation
of the elements of this aim, it insisted upon the
principle of social and moral equality: "every one to count
for one, and only for one." The standard was the well-being
of the community conceived as a community of individuals,
all of whom had equal rights and none of whom had
special privileges or exclusive avenues of access to happiness.
In a period in which the democratic spirit in England
was asserting itself against vested interests and
class-distinctions, against legalized inequalities of all sorts,
the utilitarian philosophy became the natural and perhaps
indispensable adjunct of the liberal and reforming
spirit in law, education, and politics. Every custom,
every institution, was cross-questioned; it was not allowed
to plead precedent and prior existence as a basis for continued
existence. It had to prove that it conduced to
the happiness of the community as a whole, or be legislated
out of existence or into reform. Bentham's fundamental
objection to other types of moral theories than his
own was not so much philosophic or theoretic as it was
practical. He felt that every intuitional theory tended
to dignify prejudice, convention, and fixed customs,
and so to consecrate vested interests and inequitable
institutions.</p>

<p><b>Recognition by an Opponent.</b>&mdash;The following remarks
by T. H. Green are the more noteworthy because coming
from a consistent opponent of the theory:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The chief theory of conduct which in Modern Europe has
afforded the conscientious citizen a vantage ground for judging
of the competing claims on his obedience, and enabled
him to substitute a critical and intelligent for a blind and
unquestioning conformity, has no doubt been the Utilitarian.
... Whatever the errors arising from its hedonistic psychology,
no other theory has been available for the social or
political reformer, combining so much truth with such ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
applicability. No other has offered so commanding a point
of view from which to criticize the precepts and institutions
presented as authoritative."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p></div>

<p>And again, speaking of the possibility of practical
service from theory, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The form of philosophy which in the modern world has
most conspicuously rendered this service has been the Utilitarian,
because it has most definitely announced the interest
of humanity without distinction of persons or classes, as the
end by reference to which all claims upon obedience are
ultimately to be measured.... Impartiality of reference to
human well-being has been the great lesson which the Utilitarian
has had to teach."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p></div>

<p><b>Irreconcilable Conflict of Motive and End.</b>&mdash;But unfortunately
the assertion that the happiness of all concerned
is the "universally <i>desirable</i> end," is mixed up by
early utilitarianism with an hedonistic psychology, according
to which the <i>desired</i> object is private and personal
pleasure. What is <i>desirable</i> is thus so different from what
is <i>desired</i> as to create an uncrossable chasm between the
true end of action&mdash;the happiness of all,&mdash;and the moving
spring of desire and action&mdash;private pleasure. That
there is a difference between what is <i>naturally</i> desired
(meaning by "naturally" what first arouses interest and
excites endeavor) and what is morally desirable (understanding
by this the consequences which present themselves
in adequate deliberation), is certain enough. But
the desirable must be <i>capable of becoming</i> desired, or
else there is such a contradiction that morality is impossible.
If, now, the object of desire is always private
pleasure, how can the recognition of the consequences
upon the happiness or misery of others ever become an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
effective competitor with considerations of personal well-being,
when the two conflict?<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p><b>Lack of Harmony among Pleasurable Ends.</b>&mdash;If it so
happens that the activities which secure the personal
pleasure also manage to affect others favorably, so much
the better; but since, by the theory, the individual <i>must</i>
be moved exclusively by desire for his own pleasure, woe
betide others if their happiness happens to stand in the
way.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> It could only be by accident that activities of a
large number of individuals all seeking their own private
pleasures should coincide in effecting the desirable end
of the common happiness. The outcome would, more likely,
be a competitive "war of all against all." It is of such
a situation that Kant says: "There results a harmony
like that which a certain satirical poem depicts as existing
between a married couple bent on going to ruin,
'Oh, marvelous harmony! what he wishes, she wishes too';
or like what is said of the pledge of Francis I. to the
Emperor Charles V., 'What my brother wants, that I want
too' (namely Milan)."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The existence already noted of
an unperceived and unreconcilable division between happiness
<i>in the form of future consequences</i>, and pleasure <i>as
object of desire and present moving spring</i>, thus becomes
of crucial and, for hedonistic utilitarianism, of catastrophic
importance. We shall first discuss the efforts of
utilitarianism to deal with the problem.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Mill's Formal Method.</b>&mdash;We mention first a purely
logical or formal suggestion of Mill's, not because it is
of very much significance one way or the other, but because
it helps to bring out the problem.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable,
except that each person, so far as he believes it to
be obtainable, desires his own happiness. This, however, being
a fact, we have not only all the proof which the case admits
of, but all which it is possible to require, that happiness is a
good; that each person's happiness is a good to that person;
and the general happiness, therefore, a good to the aggregate
of all persons."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p></div>

<p>It clearly does not follow that because the good of A and
B and C, etc., is <i>collectively</i>, or aggregately, a good to A
and B and C, etc., that therefore the good of A and B and
C, etc., or of anybody beyond A himself, is regarded as a
good by A&mdash;especially when the original premise is that
A seeks his own good. Because all men want to be happy
themselves, it hardly follows that each wants all to be
so. It does follow, perhaps, that that would be the <i>reasonable</i>
thing to want. If each man desires happiness
for himself, to an outside spectator looking at the matter
in the cold light of intelligence, there might be no reason
why the happiness of one should be any more precious or
desirable than that of another. From a mathematical
standpoint, the mere fact that the individual knows he
wants happiness, and knows that others are like himself,
that they too are individuals who want happiness, might
commit each individual, theoretically, to the necessity
of regarding the happiness of every other as equally
sacred with his own. But the difficulty is that there is
no chance, upon the hedonistic psychology of desire, for
this rational conviction to get in its work, even if it be
intellectually entertained. The intellectual perception and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the mechanism of human motivation remain opposed.
Mill's statement, in other words, puts the problem which
hedonistic utilitarianism has to solve.</p>

<p>Materially, as distinct from this formal statement,
utilitarianism has two instrumentalities upon which it
relies: one, internal, found in the nature of the individual;
the other, external, or in social arrangements.</p>

<p><b>I. Bentham's View of Sympathetic Pleasures.</b>&mdash;In the
long list of pleasures moving men to action which Bentham
drew up, he included what he called the social and
the semi-social. The social are the pleasures of benevolence;
the semi-social, the pleasures of amity (peace with
one's fellows) and of reputation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The pleasures of benevolence are the pleasures resulting
from the view of any pleasures supposed to be possessed by
the beings who may be the objects of benevolence" (<i>Principles
of Morals and Legislation</i>). And if it be asked what
motives lying within a man's self he has to consult the happiness
of others, "in answer to this, it cannot but be admitted
that the only interests which a man at all times and upon
all occasions is sure to find <i>adequate</i> motives for consulting
are his own. Notwithstanding this there are no occasions on
which a man has not some motives for consulting the happiness
of other men. In the first place, he has, on all occasions,
the purely social motive of sympathy and benevolence; in the
next place, he has, on most occasions, the semi-social motives
of amity and love of reputation" (<i>Ibid.</i>, ch. xix., &sect; 1). So
important finally are the sympathetic motives that he says
"The Dictates of Utility are neither more nor less than the
dictates of the most extensive and enlightened (that is, well
advised)<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> benevolence" (<i>Ibid.</i>, ch. x., &sect; 4).</p></div>

<p>In short, we are so constituted that the happiness of
others gives us happiness, their misery creates distress in
us.  We are also so constituted that, even aside from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
direct penalties imposed upon us by others, we are made
to suffer more or less by the knowledge that they have
a low opinion of us, or that we are not "popular" with
them. The more enlightened our activity, the more we
shall see how by sympathy our pleasures are directly bound
up with others, so that we shall get more pleasure by
encouraging that of others. The same course will also
indirectly increase our own, because others will be likely
to esteem and honor us just in the degree in which our
acts conduce to their pleasure. A wise or enlightened
desire for our own pleasure will thus lead us to regard the
pleasures of others in our activities.</p>

<p><b>Limitations of Doctrine.</b>&mdash;To state the doctrine is
almost to criticize it. It comes practically to saying
that a sensible and prudent self-love will make us pay
due heed to the effect of our activities upon the welfare
of others. We are to be benevolent, but the reason is
that we get more pleasure, or get pleasure more surely
and easily, that way than in any other. We are to be
kind, because upon the whole the net return of pleasure
is greater that way. This does not mean that Bentham
denied the existence of "disinterested motives" in man's
make-up; or that he held that all sympathy is coldly
calculating. On the contrary, he held that sympathetic
reactions to the well-being and suffering of others are involved
in our make-up. But as it relates to <i>motives</i> for
action he holds that the sympathetic affections influence
us only under the form of desire for our own pleasure:
they make us rejoice in the rejoicing of others, and
move us to act that others may rejoice so that we may
thereby rejoice the more. They do not move us to act
as direct interests in the welfare of others for their own
sake.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> We shall find that just as Mill transformed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
utilitarian theory of motives by substituting quality of
happiness for quantity of pleasures, so he also transformed
the earlier Benthamite conception of both the internal and
the external methods for relating the happiness of the
individual and the welfare of society.</p>

<p><b>II. Mill's Criticism.</b>&mdash;Mill charges Bentham with overlooking
the motive in man which makes him love excellence
for its own sake. "Even under the head of sympathy,"
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"his recognition does not extend to the more complex forms
of the feeling&mdash;the love of <i>loving</i>, the need of a sympathizing
support, or of an object of admiration and reverence."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
"Self culture, the training by the human being himself of his
affections and will ... is a blank in Bentham's system. The
other and co-equal part, the regulation of his outward actions,
must be altogether halting and imperfect without the first;
for how can we judge in what manner many an action will
affect the worldly interests of ourselves or others unless we
take in, as part of the question, its influence on the regulation
of our or their affections and desires?"<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p></div>

<p>In other words, Mill saw that the weakness of Bentham's
theory lay in his supposition that the factors of character,
the powers and desires which make up disposition,
are of value only as moving us to seek pleasure; to Mill
they have a worth of their own or are <i>direct</i> sources and
ingredients of happiness.  So Mill says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I regard any considerable increase of human happiness,
through mere changes in outward circumstances, unaccompanied
by changes in the state of desires, as hopeless."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> And
in his <i>Autobiography</i> speaking of his first reaction against
Benthamism, he says: "I, for the first time, gave its proper
place, among the prime necessities of human well-being, to
the internal culture of the individual. I ceased to attach almost
exclusive importance to the ordering of outward circum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>stances....
The cultivation of the feelings became one of
the cardinal points in my ethical and philosophical creed."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p></div>

<p><b>The Social Affections as Direct Interest in Others.</b>&mdash;The
importance of this changed view lies in the fact that
it compels us to regard certain desires, affections, and
motives as inherently worthy, because intrinsic constituent
factors of happiness. Thus it enables us to <i>identify</i> our
happiness with the happiness of others, to find our good
in their good, not just to seek their happiness as, upon
the whole, the most effective way of securing our own.
Our social affections are direct interests in the well-being
of others; their cultivation and expression is at one and
the same time a source of good to ourselves, and, intelligently
guided, to others. Taken in this light, it is sympathetic
emotion and imagination which make the standard
of general happiness not merely the "desirable end,"
but the desired end, the effectively working object of
endeavor.</p>

<p><b>Intrinsic Motivation of Regard for Others.</b>&mdash;If it is
asked <i>why</i> the individual should thus regard the well-being
of others as an inherent object of desire, there is,
according to Mill, but one answer: We cannot think of
ourselves save as to some extent <i>social</i> beings. Hence we
cannot separate the idea of ourselves and of our own
good from our idea of others and of their good. The
natural sentiment which is the basis of the utilitarian
morality, which gives the idea of the social good weight
with us, is the</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"desire to be in unity with our fellow creatures.... The
social state is at once so natural, so necessary, and so habitual
to man, that except in some unusual circumstances or by an
effort of voluntary abstraction, <i>he never conceives himself
otherwise than as a member of a body</i>.... Any condition,
therefore, which is essential to a state of society becomes
more and more an inseparable part of every person's concep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>tion
of the state of things he is born into and which is the
destiny of a human being." This strengthening of social
ties leads the individual "to identify his <i>feelings</i> more and
more with the good" of others. "He comes, as though instinctively,
to be conscious of himself as a being, who, <i>of
course</i>, pays regard to others. The good of others becomes
to him a thing naturally and necessarily to be attended to,
like any of the physical conditions of our existence." This
social feeling, finally, however weak, does not present itself
"as a superstition of education, or a law despotically imposed
from without, but as an attribute which it would not be well
to be without.... Few but those whose mind is a moral
blank could <i>bear</i> to lay out their course of life on the line
of paying no regard to others except so far as their own private
interest compels."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p></div>

<p>The transformation is tremendous. It is no longer a
question of acting for the general interest because that
brings most pleasure or brings it more surely and easily.
It is a question of finding one's good in the good of
others.</p>

<p><b>III. The Benthamite External Ties of Private and
General Interests.</b>&mdash;Aside from sympathy and love of
peaceful relations and good repute, Bentham relied upon
law, changes in political arrangements, and the play of
economic interests which make it worth while for the individual
to seek his own pleasure in ways that would also
conduce to the pleasure of others. Penal law can at
least make it painful for the individual to try to get
his own good in ways which bring suffering to others.
Civil legislation can at least abolish those vested interests
and class privileges which inevitably favor one at the
expense of others, and which make it customary and
natural to seek and get happiness in ways which disregard
the happiness of others. In the industrial life each
individual seeks his own advantage under such conditions
that he can achieve his end only by rendering service to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
others, that is, through exchange of commodities or
services. The proper end of legislation is then to make
political and economic conditions such that the individual
while seeking his own good will at least not inflict suffering
upon others, and positively, so far as possible, will
promote their good.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p><b>IV. Mill's Criticism.</b>&mdash;Mill's criticism does not turn
upon the importance of legislation and of social economic
arrangements in promoting the identity of individual
and general good. On the contrary, after identifying
(in a passage already quoted, <i>ante</i>, p. 286) the
ideal of utilitarian morality with love of neighbor, he
goes on:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal
utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements
should place the happiness of every individual as nearly as
possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and,
secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a
power over human character, should so use that power as to
establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association
between his own happiness and the good of the
whole."</p></div>

<p>The criticism turns upon the fact that <i>unless</i> the intrinsic
social idea, already discussed, be emphasized, any association
of private and general happiness which law and social
arrangements can effect will be external, more or less artificial
and arbitrary, and hence dissoluble either by intellectual
analysis, or by the intense prepotency of egoistic
desire.</p>

<p><b>Mill's Transformation.</b>&mdash;If, however, this idea of inherent
social ties and of oneself as a social being is presupposed,
the various external agencies have something
internal to work upon; and their effect is internal,
not external.  Their effect is not to establish a mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
<i>coincidence</i> (as with Bentham) between pleasure to oneself
and pleasure to others, but to protect, strengthen, and
foster the sense, otherwise intermittent and feeble, of the
social aspects and relations of one's own being. It is for
this reason that Mill lays more stress on <i>education</i> than
on mere external institutional changes, and, indeed, conceives
of the ultimate moral value of the institutional arrangements
as itself educative. Their value to him is
not that they are contrivances or pieces of machinery for
making the behavior of one conduce more or less automatically
to the happiness of others, but that they train and
exercise the individual in the recognition of the social elements
of his own character.</p>

<p><b>Summary of Previous Discussion.</b>&mdash;We have carried
on our discussion of the relation between the common good
as the standard for measuring rightness, and pleasure
as the end and spring of the individual's activity, in
terms of Mill's development of Bentham's utilitarianism.
But of course our results are general, and they may be
detached not only from this particular discussion, but
from the truth or falsity of utilitarianism as a technical
theory. Put positively, our results are these: (1) Moral
quality is an attribute of character, of dispositions and
attitudes which express themselves in desires and efforts.
(2) Those attitudes and dispositions are morally good
which aim at the production, the maintenance, and development
of ends in which the agent and others affected
alike find satisfaction. There is no difference (such as
early utilitarianism made) between good as standard and
as aim, because <i>only a voluntary preference for and interest
in a social good is capable, otherwise than by coincidence
or accident, of producing acts which have common
good as their result</i>. Acts which are not motivated by it as
aim cannot be trusted to secure it as result; <i>acts which
are motived by it as a living and habitual interest are
the guarantee, so far as conditions allow, of its realization</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Those who care for the general good for its own sake are
those who are surest of promoting it.</p>

<p><b>The Good Moral Character.</b>&mdash;The genuinely moral
person is one, then, in whom the habit of regarding all
capacities and habits of self from the social standpoint is
formed and active. Such an one forms his plans, regulates
his desires, and hence performs his acts with reference
to the effect they have upon the social groups of
which he is a part. He is one whose dominant attitudes
and interests are bound up with associated activities. Accordingly
he will find his happiness or satisfaction in the
promotion of these activities irrespective of the particular
pains and pleasures that accrue.</p>

<p><b>Social Interests and Sympathy.</b>&mdash;A genuine social interest
is then something much broader and deeper than an
instinctive sympathetic reaction. Sympathy is a genuine
natural instinct, varying in intensity in different individuals.
It is a precious instrumentality for the development
of social insight and socialized affection; but in
and of itself it is upon the same plane as any natural
endowment. It may lead to sentimentality or to selfishness;
the individual may shrink from scenes of misery just
because of the pain they cause him, or may seek jovial
companions because of the sympathetic pleasures he gets.
Or he may be moved by sympathy to labor for the good
of others, but, because of lack of deliberation and thoughtfulness,
be quite ignorant of what their good really is, and
do a great deal of harm. One may wish to do unto others
as he would they should do unto him, but may err egregiously
because his conception of what is desirable for
himself is radically false; or because he assumes arbitrarily
that whatever he likes is good for others, and may thus
tyrannically impose his own standards upon them. Again
instinctive sympathy is partial; it may attach itself vehemently
to those of blood kin or to immediate associates
in such a way as to favor them at the expense of others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
and lead to positive injustice toward those beyond the
charmed circle.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p><b>Transformation of Instinctive Sympathies.</b>&mdash;It still
remains true that the instinctive affectionate reactions in
their various forms (parental, filial, sexual, compassionate,
sympathetic) are the sole portions of the psychological
structure or mechanism of a man which can be relied upon
to work the identification of other's ends with one's own
interests. What is required is a <i>blending</i>, a <i>fusing</i> of the
sympathetic tendencies with all the other impulsive and
habitual traits of the self. When interest in power is
permeated with an affectionate impulse, it is protected
from being a tendency to dominate and tyrannize; it becomes
an interest in <i>effectiveness of regard for common
ends</i>. When an interest in artistic or scientific objects is
similarly fused, it loses the indifferent and coldly impersonal
character which marks the specialist as such, and
becomes an interest in the adequate &aelig;sthetic and intellectual
development of the conditions of a common life.
Sympathy does not merely <i>associate</i> one of these tendencies
<i>with</i> another; still less does it make one a means to the
other's end. It so intimately permeates them as to transform
them both into a single new and moral interest. This
same fusion protects sympathy from sentimentality and
narrowness. Blended with interest in power, in science,
in art, it is liberalized in quality and broadened in range.
In short, the fusion of affectionate reactions with the
other dispositions of the self <i>illuminates, gives perspective
and body to the former</i>, while it <i>gives social quality and
direction to the latter</i>. The result of this reciprocal absorption
is the disappearance of the natural tendencies in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
their original form <i>and the generation of moral</i>, i.e., <i>socialized
interests</i>. It is sympathy transformed into a
habitual standpoint which satisfies the demand for a standpoint
which will render the person interested in foresight of
all obscure consequences (<i>ante</i>, p. 262).</p>

<p><b>1. Social Interest and the Happiness of the Agent.</b>&mdash;We
now see what is meant by a distinctively <i>moral</i> happiness,
and how this happiness is supreme in quality as
compared with other satisfactions, irrespective of superior
intensity and duration on the part of the latter. It is
impossible to draw any fixed line between the <i>content</i> of
the moral good and of natural satisfaction. The end, the
right and only right end, of man, lies in the fullest and
freest realization of powers in their appropriate objects.
The good consists of friendship, family and political relations,
economic utilization of mechanical resources, science,
art, in all their complex and variegated forms and elements.
There is no separate and rival moral good; no
separate empty and rival "good will."</p>

<p><b>Nature of Moral Interest and Motivation.</b>&mdash;Yet <i>the interest</i>
in the social or the common and progressive realization
of these interests may properly be called a distinctive
moral interest. The degree of actual objective realization
or achievement of these ends, depends upon circumstances
and accidents over which the agent has little or
no control. The more happily situated individual who
succeeds in realizing these ends more largely we may call
more fortunate; we cannot call him morally better. The
interest in all other interests, the voluntary desire to discover
and promote them within the range of one's own
capacities, one's own material resources, and the limits
of one's own surroundings, is, however, under one's control:
<i>it is one's moral self</i>. <i>The nature and exercise of
this interest constitutes then the distinctively moral
quality in all good purposes.</i> They are morally good
not so far as objectively accomplished and possessed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
but so far as cherished in the dominant affections of the
person.</p>

<p><b>The Moral Interest as Final Happiness.</b>&mdash;Consequently
the true or final happiness of an individual, the happiness
which is not at the mercy of circumstance and change of
circumstance, lies not in objective achievement of results,
but in the supremacy within character of an alert, sincere,
and persistent interest in those habits and institutions
which forward common ends among men. Mill insisted
that quality of happiness was morally important, not
quantity. Well, that quality which is most important
is the peace and joy of mind that accompanies the abiding
and equable maintenance of socialized interests as
central springs of action. To one in whom these interests
live (and they live to some extent in every individual
not completely pathological) their exercise brings happiness
because it fulfills his life. To those in whom it is the
supreme interest it brings supreme or final happiness. It
is not preferred because it is the greater happiness, but
in being preferred as expressing the only kind of self
which the agent fundamentally wishes himself to be, it constitutes
a kind of happiness with which others cannot be
compared.  It is unique, final, invaluable.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p><b>Identity of the Individual and General Happiness.</b>&mdash;No
algebraic summing up of sympathetic pleasures, utilities
of friendship, advantages of popularity and esteem,
profits of economic exchange among equals, over against
pains from legal penalties and disapproving public opinion,
and lack of sympathetic support by others, can ever
make it even approximately certain that an individual's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
own interest, in terms of quantity of pleasures and pains,
is to regard the interest of others.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Such a demonstration,
moreover, if possible, would not support but would weaken
the moral life. It would reduce the manifestation of character
to selecting greater rather than less amounts of
homogeneous ends. It would degrade reflection and consideration
to ingenuity in detecting where larger quantities
of pleasures lie, and to skill in performing sums of
addition and subtraction. Even if such a scheme could be
demonstrated, every one except the most languid and
phlegmatic of pleasure-seekers would reject a life built
upon it. Not only the "good," but the more vigorous and
hearty of the "bad," would scorn a life in which character,
selfhood, had no significance, and where the experimental
discovery and testing of destiny had no place. The identity
of individual and general happiness is a <i>moral</i> matter;
it depends, that is, upon the reflective and intentional development
of that type of character which identifies itself
with common ends, and which is happy in these ends
just because it has made them its own.</p>

<p><b>2. Social Ends and the Happiness of Others.</b>&mdash;The
same principle holds of the happiness of others. Happiness
means the expression of the active tendencies of a self
in their appropriate objects. Moral happiness means the
satisfaction which comes when the dominant active tendencies
are made interests in the maintenance and propagation
of the things that make life worth living. Others, also,
can be happy and should be happy only upon the same
terms. Regard for the happiness of others means <i>regard
for those conditions and objects which permit others freely
to exercise their own powers from their own initiative, reflection,
and choice</i>. Regard for their final happiness (i.e.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
for a happiness whose <i>quality</i> is such that it cannot be
<i>externally</i> added to or subtracted from) demands that
these others shall find the controlling objects of preference,
resolution, and endeavor in the things that are worth
while.</p>

<p><b>3. Happiness and Common Ends.</b>&mdash;For all alike, in
short, the chief thing is the discovery and promotion of
those activities and active relationships in which the capacities
of all concerned are effectively evoked, exercised, and
put to the test. It is difficult for a man to attain a point
of view from which steadily to apprehend how his own
activities affect and modify those of others. It is hard,
that is, to learn to accommodate one's ends to those of
others; to adjust, to give way here, and fit in there with
respect to our aims. But difficult as this is, it is easy compared
with the difficulty of acting <i>in such a way</i> for ends
which are helpful to others as will call out and make effective
their activities.</p>

<p><b>Moral Democracy.</b>&mdash;If the vice of the criminal, and of
the coarsely selfish man is to disturb the aims and the good
of others; if the vice of the ordinary egoist, and of every
man, upon his egoistic side, is to neglect the interests of
others; the vice of the social leader, of the reformer, of
the philanthropist and the specialist in every worthy cause
of science, or art, or politics, is to seek ends which promote
the social welfare in ways which fail to engage the
active interest and co&ouml;peration of others.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The conception
of conferring the good upon others, or at least of attaining
it for them, which is our inheritance from the aristocratic
civilization of the past, is so deeply embodied
in religious, political, and charitable institutions and in
moral teachings, that it dies hard. Many a man, feeling
himself justified by the social character of his ultimate aim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
(it may be economic, or educational, or political), is
genuinely confused or exasperated by the increasing antagonism
and resentment which he evokes, because he has
not enlisted in his pursuit of the "common" end the freely
co&ouml;perative activities of others. This co&ouml;peration must be
the root principle of the morals of democracy. It must be
confessed, however, that it has as yet made little progress.</p>

<p>Our traditional conceptions of the morally great man,
the moral hero and leader, the exceptionally good social
and political character, all work against the recognition
of this principle either in practice or theory. They foster
the notion that it is somebody's particular business to reach
by his more or less isolated efforts (with "following," or
obedience, or unreflective subordination on the part of
others) a needed social good. Some genius is to lead the
way; others are to adopt and imitate. Moreover, the
method of awakening and enlisting the activities of all
concerned in pursuit of the end seems slow; it seems to
postpone accomplishment indefinitely. But in truth a
common end which is not made such by common, free voluntary
co&ouml;peration in process of achievement is common in
name only. It has no support and guarantee in the activities
which it is supposed to benefit, because it is not the
fruit of those activities. Hence, it does not stay put.
It has to be continually buttressed by appeal to external,
not voluntary, considerations; bribes of pleasure, threats
of harm, use of force. It has to be undone and done over.
There is no way to escape or evade this law of happiness,
that it resides in the exercise of the active capacities of
a voluntary agent; and hence no way to escape or evade
the law of a common happiness, that it must reside in
the congruous exercise of the voluntary activities of all
concerned. The inherent irony and tragedy of much
that passes for a high kind of socialized activity is precisely
that it seeks a common good by methods which forbid
its being either common or a good.</p>

THE PLACE OF REASON IN THE MORAL LIFE;
MORAL KNOWLEDGE</h2>


<h4>&sect; 1. PROBLEM OF REASON AND DESIRE</h4>

<p><b>Intelligence and Reason in a Moral Act.</b>&mdash;A voluntary
act is one which involves intention, purpose, and thus
some degree of deliberateness. It is this trait which marks
off the voluntary act from a purely unconscious one (like
that of a machine) and from one which yields to the superior
urgency of present feeling, one which is pushed on
from behind, as an instinctive or impulsive act, instead
of being called out by some possibility ahead. This factor
of forethought and of preference after comparison for
some one of the ends considered, is the factor of intelligence
involved in every voluntary act. To be intelligent in action
is, however, a far-reaching affair. To know what one
is really about is a large and difficult order to fill; so large
and difficult that it is the heart of morality.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The relevant
bearings of any act are subtler and larger than those
which can be foreseen and than those which will be <i>unless</i>
special care is taken. The tendencies which strongly move
one to a certain act are often exactly those which tend
to prevent one's seeing the effect of the act upon his own
habits and upon the well-being of others. The internal
forces and the external circumstance which evoke the idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
of an end and of the means of attaining it are frequently
also those which deflect intelligence to a narrow and partial
view. The demand for a standard by which to regulate
judgment of ends is thus the demand not only for intelligence,
but for a certain kind of intelligence.</p>

<p>In short, a truly moral (or right) act is one which is
intelligent in an emphatic and peculiar sense; it is a <i>reasonable</i>
act. It is not merely one which is thought of, and
thought of as good, at the moment of action, but one which
will continue to be thought of as "good" in the most alert
and persistent reflection.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> For by "reasonable" action we
mean such action as recognizes and observes all the necessary
conditions; action in which impulse, instinct, inclination,
habit, opinion, prejudice (as the case may be) are
moderated, guided, and determined by considerations
which lie outside of and beyond them. Not merely to form
ends and select means, but to judge the <i>worth</i> of these
means and ends by a standard, is then the distinctive province
of reason in morals. Its outcome is <i>moral knowledge</i>;
that is judgments of right and wrong, both in general,
and in the particular and perplexing cases as they arise.
This is the topic of the present chapter.</p>

<p><b>Typical Problems.</b>&mdash;The problem of moral knowledge is
in its general form: Is there a distinct and separate faculty
of moral reason and knowledge, or is there but one power
of judgment which varies with its object? The former
view is the intuitional (from Latin, <i>intueor</i>: to look at);
it is associated with theories, which, like the Kantian, emphasize
attitudes, not results and intentions; while the view
which holds that there is but one form of thought which,
in morals, concerns itself with results, and with their association
with the present aim, is the empirical. There
are two especial difficulties which lead to the upholding of
the intuitional point of view, difficulties which any theory
of moral knowledge has to meet. They are (I) The Rela<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>tion
of Desire and Reason, and (II) the Knowledge of
Private and General Good.</p>

<p><b>1. Desire and Reason.</b>&mdash;Ordinary knowledge in practical
matters follows the line set by desire. Hunger makes
us think of food and of how to get it; sociable desire, of
friends, and how to secure their companionship, and so on.
Now a surging mass of desires, vehement and bulky, may
concentrate itself upon the idea of any end; and as soon as
it does so, it tends to shut out wider considerations. As
we have just seen, it is the object of reason to give us a
calm, objective, broad, and general survey of the field.
Desires work against this, and unless (so runs the argument)
there is a faculty which works wholly independent of
desires, as our ordinary practical knowledge does not, it
is absurd to suppose there can be a rational principle which
will correct and curb desire.</p>

<p><b>2. Private and General Good.</b>&mdash;Since the wide and
permanent good is social, it is urged that unless we
have an independent faculty of moral knowledge, our judgment
will be subservient to the ends of private desire, and
hence will not place itself at the public point of view. Or,
if it does so, it will be simply as a matter of expediency
to calculate better the means for getting our own pleasure.
In general, it is urged that only a faculty of knowledge
completely independent of personal wishes, habits, purposes
can secure judgments possessing inherent dignity
and authoritativeness; since these require an elevated,
impartial, universal, and necessary point of view. We shall
in the sequel attempt to show that this view of knowledge
results from the false conception of desire as having pleasure
for its object, and from a false conception of the relation
of intent and motive. When these errors are corrected,
there is no ground to assume any special faculty of
moral intelligence, save as the one capacity of thought is
specialized into a particular mental habit by being constantly
occupied in judging values. We shall try to show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
that the broad and public point of view is secured by fusion
of impulses with sympathetic affections. We shall begin
with stating and criticizing the views of Kant, who upholds
the doctrine of a separate independent Moral Reason
in its most extreme form.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. KANT'S THEORY OF PRACTICAL REASON</h4>

<p>Kant is at one with the hedonist as regards the natural
object of desire; it is pleasure. All purposes and ends that
spring from inclination and natural tendency come under
one head: self-love. Hence, the ordinary use of intelligence
is confined to the matter of passing upon what constitutes
the individual's private happiness and how he shall secure
it. There are then fundamental contrasts between ordinary
practical activity and genuinely moral activity,
contrasts which reflect themselves in the theory of the nature
and function of moral knowledge. (1) The moral end
is <i>unqualified</i>, absolute, categorical. It is not something
which we can pick or leave at our option. Morality is the
region of final ends, ends not to be disputed or questioned;
and reason must set forth such final ends. Since, however,
happiness is not a morally necessary end, intelligence in its
behalf can only give hypothetical counsel and advice: <i>if</i>
you would be happy, or happy in this, or that way, then
take such and such measures. Reason which promulgates
ends must be of a different sort from the intelligence which
simply searches for means.</p>

<p>(2) Morality is not qualified, but <i>certain</i> in its requirements.
The most inexperienced, the humblest, the one
most restricted in his circumstances and opportunities,
must know what is morally required as surely as the
wisest and most educated. Hence moral reason must utter
its precepts clearly and unambiguously. But no one can be
<i>sure</i> what happiness is, or whether a given act will bring joy
or sorrow. "The problem of determining certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
what action would promote the happiness of a rational
being is insoluble." (Abbott's <i>Kant</i>, p. 36.) The demand
for <i>certainty</i> of precepts in moral matters also requires
a special faculty.</p>

<p>(3) Morality, which is inexorable and certain in its demands,
is also <i>universal</i> in its requirements. Its laws are
the same yesterday, to-day, and forever, the same for one
as for another. Now happiness notoriously varies with the
condition and circumstances of a person, as well as with
the conditions of different peoples and epochs. Intelligence
with reference to happiness can only give counsel,
not even rules, so variable is happiness. It can only advise
that upon the average, under certain conditions, a given
course of action has usually promoted happiness. When
we add that the commands of morality are also universal
with respect to the different inclinations of different individuals,
we are made emphatically aware of the necessity of
a rational standpoint, which in its impartiality totally
transcends the ends and plans that grow out of the ordinary
experience of an individual.</p>

<p><b>An A Priori Reason Kant's Solution.</b>&mdash;The net outcome
is that only a reason which is separate and independent
of all experience is capable of meeting the requirements
of morality. What smacks in its origin and aim
of experience is tainted with self-love; is partial, temporary,
uncertain, and relative or dependent. The moral law
is unqualified, necessary, and universal. Hence we have to
recognize in man as a moral being a faculty of reason
which expresses itself in the law of conduct <i>a priori</i> to all
experience of desire, pleasure, and pain. Besides his sensuous
nature (with respect to which knowledge is bound
up with appetite) man has a purely rational nature, which
manifests itself in the consciousness of the absolute authority
of universal law.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Formal Character of Such Reason.</b>&mdash;This extreme separation
of reason from experience brings with it, however,
a serious problem. We shall first state this problem; and
then show that its artificial and insoluble character serves
as a refutation of Kant's theory of a transcendental,
or wholly non-natural and non-empirical, mode of knowledge.
Reason which is wholly independent of experience
of desires and their results is, as Kant expressly declares,
purely <i>formal</i>. (Abbott's <i>Kant</i>, p. 33; p. 114.) That is
to say, it is <i>empty</i>; it does not point out or indicate anything
particular to be done. It cannot say be industrious,
or prudent, generous; give, or refrain from giving, so much
money to this particular man at this particular time under
just these circumstances. All it says is that morality is
rational and requires man to follow the law of reason. But
the law of reason is just that a man should follow the law
of reason. And to the inevitable inquiry "What then is the
law of reason?" the answer still is: To follow the law of
reason. How do we break out of this empty circle into
specific knowledge of the specific right things to be done?
Kant has an answer, which we shall now consider.</p>

<p><b>Kant's Method.</b>&mdash;He proceeds as follows: The law is
indeed purely formal or empty (since, once more, all specific
ends are "empirical" and changeable), but it is so
because it is universal. Now nothing which is universal can
contradict itself. All we need to do is to take any proposed
principle of any act and ask ourselves whether it
can be universalized without self-inconsistency. If it cannot
be, the act is wrong. If it can be, the act is right.
For example:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"May I, when in distress, make a promise with the intention
not to keep it?... The shortest way, and an unerring one to
discover the answer to the question whether a lying promise
is consistent with duty, is to ask myself, Should I be content
that my maxim (to extricate myself from trouble by a
false promise) should hold good as a universal law, for myself
as well as for others? And should I be able to say to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
myself, every one may make a deceitful promise when he finds
himself in a difficulty from which he cannot otherwise extricate
himself? Then I personally become aware that while I
can will the lie, I can by no means will that lying should
be a universal law. For with such a law there would be no
such thing as a promise. No one should have any faith in
the proffered intention, or, if they do so over hastily, would
pay one back in one's own coin at the first opportunity" (<i>Op.
cit.</i>, p. 19).</p></div>

<p>The principle if made universal simply contradicts itself,
and thus reveals that it is no principle at all, not rational.
Summing this up in a formula, we get as our standard of
right action the principle: "Act as if the maxim of thy
action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature"
(<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 39).</p>

<p>The procedure thus indicated seems simple. As long as
an individual considers the purpose or motive of his action
as if it were merely a matter of that one deed; as if it were
an isolated thing, there is no rationality, no consciousness
of moral law or principle. But let the individual imagine
himself gifted with such power that, if he acts, the motive
of his act will become a fixed, a regular law in the constitution
of things. Would he, as a rational being, be willing to
bring about such a universalization,&mdash;can he, with equanimity
as a reasonable being, contemplate such an outcome?
If he can, the act is right; if not (as in the case of making
a lying promise), wrong.</p>

<p>No sensible person would question the instructiveness of
this scheme in the concrete. It indicates that the value of
reason&mdash;of abstraction and generalization&mdash;in conduct is
to help us escape from the partiality that flows from desire
and emotion in their first and superficial manifestations,
and to attain a more unified and permanent end. As a
method (though not the only one) of realizing the <i>full
meaning</i> of a proposed course of action, nothing could be
better than asking ourselves how we should like to be
committed forever to its principle; how we should like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
to have others committed to it and to treat us according
to it? Such a method is well calculated to make us face
our proposed end in its impartial consequences; to teach the
danger of cherishing merely those results which are most
congenial to our passing whim and our narrow conception
of personal profit. In short, by generalizing a purpose
we make its <i>general</i> character evident.</p>

<p>But this method does not proceed (as Kant would have
it) from a mere consideration of moral law <i>apart from a
concrete end, but from an end in so far as it persistently
approves itself to reflection after an adequate survey of
it in all its bearings</i>. It is the possibility of <i>generalizing
the concrete end</i> that Kant falls back upon.</p>

<p>Other illustrations which Kant offers enforce the same
lesson. He suggests the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) A man in despair from misfortune considers suicide.
"Now he inquires whether the maxim of his action could become
a universal law of nature." We see at once that a
system of nature by which it should be a law to destroy life
by means of the very feeling&mdash;self-love&mdash;whose nature it is
to impel to the maintenance of life, would contradict itself
and therefore could not exist.</p>

<p>(2) A man who has a certain talent is tempted from sluggishness
and love of amusement not to cultivate it. But if he
applies the principle he sees that, while a system of nature
might subsist if his motive became a law (so that all people
devoted their lives to idleness and amusement), yet he cannot
<i>will</i> that such a system should receive absolute realization.
As a rational being he necessarily also wills that faculties
be developed since they serve for all sorts of possible
purposes.</p>

<p>(3) A prosperous man, who sees some one else to be
wretched, is tempted to pay no attention to it, alleging that
it is no concern of his. Now, if this attitude were made a
universal law of nature, the human race might subsist and
even get on after a fashion; but it is impossible to will that
such a principle should have the validity of a law of nature.
Such a will would contradict itself, for many cases would
occur in which the one willing would need the love and
sympathy of others; he could not then without contradicting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
himself wish that selfish disregard should become a regular, a
fixed uniformity.</p></div>

<p><b>The Social End is the Rational End.</b>&mdash;These illustrations
make it clear that the "contradiction" Kant really
depends upon to reveal the wrongness of acts, is the introduction
of friction and disorder among the various concrete
ends of the individual. He insists especially that the social
relations of an act bring out its general purport. A
right end is one which can be projected harmoniously
into the widest and broadest survey of life which the
individual can make. A "system of nature" or of conduct
in which love of life should lead to its own destruction
certainly contradicts itself. A course of action which
should include all the tendencies that make for amusement
and sluggishness would be inconsistent with a scheme
of life which would take account of other tendencies&mdash;such
as interest in science, in music, in friendship, in business
achievement, which are just as real constituents of the
individual, although perhaps not so strongly felt at the
moment. A totally callous and cruel mode of procedure
certainly "contradicts" a course of life in which every
individual is so placed as to be dependent upon the sympathy
and upon the help of others. It is the province
of reason to call up a sufficiently wide view of the consequences
of an intention as to enable us to realize such
inconsistencies and contradictions if they exist; to put
before us, not through any logical manipulation of the
principle of contradiction, but through memory and imagination
a particular act, proposal, or suggestion as a portion
of a connected whole of life; to make real to us that
no man, no act, and no satisfaction of any man, falls or
stands to itself, but that it affects and is affected by others.
Our conclusion is: the right as the <i>rational</i> good means
that which is harmonious with all the capacities and desires
of the self, that which expands them into a co&ouml;perative
whole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Kant's Introduction of Social Factors.</b>&mdash;The further
development which Kant gives the formula already quoted
(p. 312) goes far to remove the appearance of opposition
between the utilitarian social standard and his own abstract
rationalism. Kant points out that according to
his view the moral or rational will is its own end. Hence
every rational person is always an end, never a means:&mdash;this,
indeed, is what we mean by a person. But every normal
human being is a rational person. Consequently
another formula for his maxim is: "So act as to treat
humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any
other, as an end, never as a means merely." The man who
contemplates suicide "uses a person merely as a means to
maintaining a tolerable condition of life." He who would
make a lying promise to another makes that other one
merely a means to his profit, etc. Moreover, since all persons
are equally ends in themselves and are to be equally
regarded in behavior, we may say the standard of right is
the notion of a "Kingdom of Ends"&mdash;the idea of "the union
of different rational beings in a system by common laws."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>These propositions are rather formal, but the moment
we put definite meaning into them, they suggest that the
good for any man is that in which the welfare of others
counts as much as his own. The right is that action
which, so far as in it lies, combines into a whole of common
interests and purposes the otherwise conflicting aims and
interests of different persons. So interpreted, the Kantian
formula differs in words, rather than in idea, from Bentham's
happiness of all concerned "each counting for one
and only one"; from Mill's statement that the "deeply
rooted conception which every individual even now has of
himself as a social being tends to make him feel it as one
of his natural wants, that there should be harmony between
his feelings and aims and those of his fellow creatures."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
In all of these formul&aelig; we find re-statements of our conception
that the good is the activities in which all men
participate so that the powers of each are called out, put
to use, and re&euml;nforced.</p>

<p><b>Consequent Transformation of Theory of Reason.</b>&mdash;Now
if the common good, in the form of a society of individuals,
as a kingdom of ends, is the object with reference
to which the ends of desire have to be rationalized, Kant's
theory of an <i>a priori</i> and empty Reason is completely made
over. In strict logic Kant contradicts himself when he
says that we are to generalize the end of desire, so as to
see whether it could become a universal law. For according
to him no end of desire (since it is private and a
form of self-love) <i>can possibly be generalized</i>. He is setting
up as a method of enlightenment precisely the very
impossibility (impossible, that is, on his own theory that
private happiness is the end of desire) which made him
first resort to his <i>a priori</i> and transcendental reason. No
more complete contradiction can be imagined.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we neglect the concrete, empirical
conditions and consequences of the object of desire,
there is no motive whatsoever that may not be generalized.
There is no <i>formal</i> contradiction in acting always on a
motive of theft, unchastity, or insolence. All that Kant's
method can require, in strict logic, is that the individual
always, under similar circumstances, act from the same motive.
Be willing to be always dishonest, or impure, or proud
in your intent; achieve consistency in the badness of your
motives, and you will be good! Doubtless no one, not even
the worst man, would be willing to be universally consistent
in his badness. But this is not in the least a matter
of a purely formal, logical inconsistency of the motive
with itself;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> it is due rather to that <i>conflict among diverse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
desires, and different objects for which one strives, which
makes him aware that at some time he should want to act
kindly and fairly</i>.</p>

<p><b>Organization of Desires from the Social Standpoint.</b>&mdash;What
Kant is really insisting upon at bottom is, then, the
demand for such a revision of desire as it casually and
unreflectively presents itself as would make the desire a
consistent expression of the whole body of the purposes of
the self. What he demands is that a desire shall not be
accepted as an adequate motive till it has been organized
into desire for an end which will be compatible with the
whole system of ends involved in the capacities and tendencies
of the agent. This is true rationalization. And
he further warns us that only when a particular desire
has in view a good which is social will it meet this requirement.
This brings us to our next problem. Just
what is the process by which we judge of the worth of particular
proposals, plans, courses of actions, desires?
Granted that a generalized good, a socialized happiness,
is the point of view at which we must place ourselves to
secure the reasonable point of view, how does this point of
view become an operative method?</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. MORAL SENSE INTUITIONALISM</h4>

<p>So far, our conclusions are (1) that the province of
reason is to enable us to generalize our concrete ends; to
form such ends as are consistent with one another, and
re&euml;nforce one another, introducing continuity and force,
where otherwise there would be division and weakness; and
(2) that only social ends are ultimately reasonable, since
they alone permit us to organize our acts into consistent
wholes. We have now, however, to consider how this conception
takes effect in detail; how it is employed to determine
the right or the reasonable in a given situation. We
shall approach this problem by considering a form of in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>tuitionalism
historically prior to that of Kant. This emphasizes
the direct character of moral knowledge in particular
cases, and assimilates moral knowledge to the
analogy of sense perception, which also deals directly with
specific objects; it insists, however, that a different kind
of faculty of knowledge operates in the knowledge of acts
from that which operates in the knowledge of things. Our
underlying aim here is to bring out the relation of immediate
appreciation to deliberate reflection, with a view to
showing that the reasonable standpoint, that of the common
good, becomes effective through the socialized attitudes
and emotions of a person's own character.</p>

<p><b>Moral Sense.</b>&mdash;This theory holds that rightness is an
intrinsic, absolute quality of special acts, and as such is
immediately known or recognized for what it is. Just as
a white color is known as white, a high tone as high, a
hard body as existent, etc., so an act which is right is
known as right. In each case, the quality and the fact are
so intimately and inherently bound together that it is absurd
to think of one and not know the other. As a theory
of moral judgment, intuitionalism is thus opposed to utilitarianism,
which holds that rightness is not an inherent
quality but one relative to and borrowed from external
and more or less remote consequences. While some
forms of intuitionalism hold that this moral quality belongs
to general rules or to classes of ends, the form we
are now to consider holds that the moral quality of an
individual act cannot be borrowed even from a moral law,
but shines forth as an absolute and indestructible part of
the motive of the act itself. Because the theory in question
sticks to the direct perception of the immediately present
quality of acts, it is usually called, in analogy with
the direct perception of eye or ear, the moral sense theory.</p>

<p><b>Objections to Theory.</b>&mdash;The objections to this theory
in the extreme form just stated may be brought under
two heads: (1) There is no evidence to prove that all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
acts are directly characterized by the possession of absolute
and self-evident rightness and wrongness; there is
much evidence to show that this quality when presented by
acts can, as a rule, be traced to earlier instruction, to the
pressure of correction and punishment, and to association
with other experiences. (2) While in this way many acts,
perhaps almost all, of the average mature person of a good
moral environment, have acquired a direct moral coloring,
making unnecessary elaborate calculation or reference to
general principles, yet there is nothing infallible in such
intuitively presented properties. An act may present itself
as thoroughly right and yet may be, in reality, wrong.
The function of conscious deliberation and reasoning is
precisely to detect the existence of and to correct such
intuitive cases.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p><b>I. Direct Perception as Effect of Habits.</b>&mdash;It must be
admitted, as a result of any unprejudiced examination,
that a large part of the acts, motives, and plans of the
adult who has had favorable moral surroundings seem to
possess directly, and in their own intrinsic make-up, rightness
or wrongness or moral indifference. To think of
lying or stealing is one with thinking of it as wrong;
to recall or suggest an act of kindness is the same as
thinking of it as right; to think of going after mail is to
think of an act free from either rightness or wrongness.
With the average person it is probably rare for much
time to be spent in figuring out whether an act is right
or wrong, after the idea of that act has once definitely
presented itself. So far as the facts of moral experience
in such cases are concerned, the "moral sense" theory
appears to give a correct description.</p>

<p>(1) But the conclusion that, therefore, moral goodness
or badness is and always has been an inherent, abso<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>lute
property of the act itself, overlooks well-known psychological
principles. In all perception, in all recognition,
there is a funding or capitalizing of the results of past
experience by which the results are rendered available in
new experiences. Even a young child recognizes a table,
a chair, a glass of milk, a dog, as soon as he sees it;
there is no analysis, no conscious interpretation. Distance,
direction, size, under normal circumstances, are
perceived with the same assurance and ease. But there
was a time when all these things were learning; when conscious
experimentation involving interpretation took
place. Such perceptions, moreover, take place under
the guidance of others; pains are taken indelibly
to stamp moral impressions by associating them with
intense, vivid, and mysterious or awful emotional
accompaniments.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Anthropological and historical accounts of different
races and peoples tell the same story. Acts once entirely
innocent of moral distinctions have acquired, under differing
circumstances and sometimes for trivial and absurd
reasons, different moral values:&mdash;one and the same sort
of act being stamped here as absolute guilt, there as an
act of superior and heroic virtue. Now it would be fallacious
to argue (as some do) that because distinctions of
moral quality have been acquired and are not innate, they
are therefore unreal when they are acquired. Yet the
fact of gradual development proves that no fixed line exists
where it can be said the case is closed; that just this is
henceforth forever right or wrong; that there shall be no
further observation of consequences, no further correction
and revision of present "intuitions."</p>

<p>(2) Our immediate moral recognitions take place, moreover,
only under usual circumstances. There is after all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
no such thing as complete moral maturity; all persons
are still more or less children&mdash;in process of learning
moral distinctions. The more intense their moral interests,
the more childlike, the more open, flexible, and growing
are their minds. It is only the callous and indifferent,
or at least the conventional, who find all acts and projects
so definitely right and wrong as to render reflection
unnecessary. "New occasions teach new duties," but they
teach them only to those who recognize that they are not
already in possession of adequate moral judgments. Any
other view destroys the whole meaning of reflective morality
and marks a relapse to the plane of sheer custom. Extreme
intuitionalism and extreme moral conservatism; dislike
to calculation and reflection, for fear of innovations
with attendant trouble and discomfort, are usually found
to go together.</p>

<p><b>II. Direct Perception No Guarantee of Validity.</b>&mdash;This
suggests our second objection. The existence of immediate
moral quality, the direct and seemingly final
possession of rightness, as matter of fact, is not adequate
proof of validity. At best, it furnishes a presumption
of correctness, in the absence of grounds for questioning
it, in fairly familiar situations. (a) There is nothing
more direct, more seemingly self-evident, than inveterate
prejudice. When class or vested interest is enlisted in
the maintenance of the custom or institution which is
expressed in a prejudice, the most vicious moral judgments
assume the guise of self-conscious sanctity. (b)
A judgment which is correct under usual circumstances
may become quite unfit, and therefore wrong, if persisted
in under new conditions. Life, individual and social, is in
constant process of change; and there is always danger
of error in clinging to judgments adjusted to older circumstances.
"The good is the enemy of the better." It
is not merely false ideas of the values of life that have to
be re-formed, but ideas once true. When economic, politi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>cal,
and scientific conditions are modifying themselves as
rapidly and extensively as they are in our day, it is reconstruction
of moral judgment that needs emphasis,
rather than the existence of a lot of ready-made "intuitions."
When readjustment is required, deliberate inquiry
is the only alternative to inconsiderate, undirected,
and hence probably violent changes:&mdash;changes involving
undue relaxation of moral ties on one side and arbitrary
reactions on the other.</p>

<p><b>Deliberation and Intuition.</b>&mdash;It is indeed absurd to
set immediate recognition of quality and indirect calculation
of more or less remote consequences, intuition
and thought, over against each other as if they were rivals.
For they are mutually supplementary. As we saw in a
previous chapter, the foresight of future results calls
out an <i>immediate reaction</i> of satisfaction and dissatisfaction,
of happiness or dislike. (See p. 272.) It is
just as false to say that we calculate only future pains
and pleasures (instead of changes in the world of things
and persons) as it is to say that anticipations of the
changes to be wrought in the world by our act are not
accompanied by an immediate emotional appreciation of
their value. The notion that deliberation upon the various
alternatives open to us is simply a cold-blooded setting
down of various items to our advantage, and various other
items to our disadvantage (as Robinson Crusoe wrote
down in bookkeeping fashion his miseries and blessings),
and then striking an algebraic balance, implies something
that never did and never could happen. Deliberation
is a process of active, suppressed, rehearsal; of imaginative
dramatic performance of various deeds carrying
to their appropriate issues the various tendencies which
we feel stirring within us. When we see in imagination this
or that change brought about, there is a direct sense of
the amount and kind of worth which attaches to it, as
real and as direct, if not as strong, as if the act were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
really performed and its consequence really brought home
to us.</p>

<p><b>Deliberation as Dramatic Rehearsal.</b>&mdash;We, indeed, estimate
the import or significance of any present desire
or impulse by forecasting what it would come or amount
to if carried out; literally its consequences define its <i>consequence</i>,
its meaning and importance. But if these
consequences were conceived <i>merely as remote</i>, if their
picturing did not at once arouse a present sense of peace,
of fulfillment, or of dissatisfaction, of incompletion and
irritation, the process of thinking out consequences would
remain purely intellectual. It would be as barren of
influence upon behavior as the mathematical speculations
of a disembodied angel. Any actual experience of reflection
upon conduct will show that every foreseen result
at once stirs our present affections, our likes and dislikes,
our desires and aversions. There is developed a running
commentary which stamps values at once as good or evil.
It is this direct sense of value, not the consciousness of
general rules or ultimate goals, which finally determines
the worth of the act to the agent. Here is the inexpugnable
element of truth in the intuitional theory. Its
error lies in conceiving this immediate response of appreciation
as if it excluded reflection instead of following
directly upon its heels. Deliberation is actually an imaginative
rehearsal of various courses of conduct. We
give way, <i>in our mind</i>, to some impulse; we try, <i>in our
mind</i>, some plan. Following its career through various
steps, we find ourselves in imagination in the presence of
the consequences that would follow: and as we then like
and approve, or dislike and disapprove, these consequences,
we find the original impulse or plan good or bad.
Deliberation is dramatic and active, not mathematical and
impersonal; and hence it has the intuitive, the direct factor
in it. The advantage of a mental trial, prior to the overt
trial (for the act after all is itself also a trial, a prov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>ing
of the idea that lies back of it), is that it is retrievable,
whereas overt consequences remain. They cannot be recalled.
Moreover, many trials may mentally be made in a
short time. The imagining of various plans carried out
furnishes an opportunity for many impulses which at
first are not in evidence at all, to get under way. Many
and varied direct sensings, appreciations, take place.
When many tendencies are brought into play, there is
clearly much greater probability that the capacity of self
which is really needed and appropriate will be brought
into action, and thus a truly reasonable happiness result.
The tendency of deliberation to "polarize" the various lines
of activity into opposed alternatives, into incompatible
"either this or that," is a way of forcing into clear recognition
the importance of the issue.</p>

<p><b>The Good Man's Judgments as Standard.</b>&mdash;This explains
the idea of Aristotle that only the good man is a
good judge of what is really good. Such an one will take
satisfaction in the thought of noble ends and will recoil
at the idea of base results. Because of his formed capacities,
his organized habits and tendencies, he will respond
to a suggested end with an emotion which confers its
appropriate kind and shade of value. The brave man
is sensitive to all acts and plans so far as they involve
energy and endurance in overcoming painful obstacles;
the kindly man responds at once to the elements that
affect the well-being of others. The moral sense or direct
appreciations of the good man may thus be said to furnish
the standard of right and wrong. There are few persons
who, when in doubt regarding a difficult matter of conduct,
do not think of some other person in whose goodness
they believe, and endeavor to direct and clinch their
own judgment by imagining how such an one would react
in a similar situation&mdash;what he would find congenial and
what disagreeable. Or else they imagine what that other
person would think of them if he knew of their doing such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
and such an act. And while this method cannot supply the
standard of their own judgment, cannot determine the
right or wrong for their own situations, it helps emancipate
judgment from selfish partialities, and it facilitates
a freer and more flexible play of imagination in construing
and appreciating the situation.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4. THE PLACE OF GENERAL RULES</h4>

<p>Between such a highly generalized and formal principle
as that of Kant, and the judgment of particular cases, we
have intermediate generalizations; rules which are broad
as compared with individual deeds, but narrow as compared
with some one final principle. What are their rational
origin, place, and function? We have here again
both the empirical and the intuitional theories of knowledge,
having to deal with the same fundamental difficulty:
What is the relation of the special rule to the general
principle on one side and to the special case on the other?
The more general, the more abstractly rational the rule,
the vaguer and less applicable it is. The more definite
and fixed it is, the greater the danger that it will be a
Procrustean bed, mutilating the rich fullness of the individual
act, or destroying its grace and freedom by making
it conform servilely to a hard and fast rule. Our analysis
will accordingly be devoted to bringing to light the conditions
under which a rule may be rational and yet be of
specific help.</p>

<p><b>I. Intuitionalism and Casuistry.</b>&mdash;Utilitarianism at
least holds that rules are derived from actual cases of conduct;
hence there must be points of likeness between the
cases to be judged and the rules for judging them. But
rules which do not originate from a consideration of
special cases, which simply descend out of the blue sky,
have only the most mechanical and external relation to the
individual acts to be judged.  Suppose one is convinced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
that the rule of honesty was made known just in and of
itself by a special faculty, and had absolutely nothing
to do with the recollection of past cases or the forecast
of possible future circumstances. How would such a rule
apply itself to any particular case which needed to be
judged? What bell would ring, what signal would be
given, to indicate that just <i>this</i> case is the appropriate
case for the application of the rule of honest dealing?
And if by some miracle this question were answered so one
knows that here is a case for the rule of honesty, how would
we know just what course in detail the rule calls for?
For the rule, to be applicable to all cases, must omit the
conditions which differentiate one case from another; it
must contain only the very few similar elements which are
to be found in all honest deeds. Reduced to this skeleton,
not much would be left save the bare injunction to be honest
whatever happens, leaving it to chance, the ordinary judgment
of the individual, or to external authority to find
out just <i>what</i> honesty specifically means in the given case.</p>

<p>This difficulty is so serious that all systems which have
committed themselves to belief in a number of hard and
fast rules having their origin in conscience, or in the word
of God impressed upon the human soul or externally revealed,
always have had to resort to a more and more
complicated procedure to cover, if possible, all the cases.
The moral life is finally reduced by them to an elaborate
formalism and legalism.</p>

<p><b>Illustration in Casuistry.</b>&mdash;Suppose, for example, we
take the Ten Commandments as a starting-point. They
are only ten, and naturally confine themselves to general
ideas, and ideas stated mainly in negative form. Moreover,
the same act may be brought under more than one
rule. In order to resolve the practical perplexities and
uncertainties which inevitably arise under such circumstances,
<i>Casuistry</i> is built up (from the Latin <i>casus</i>,
case).  The attempt is made to foresee all the different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
cases of action which may conceivably occur, and provide
in advance the exact rule for each case. For example, with
reference to the rule "do not kill," a list will be made of
all the different situations in which killing might occur:&mdash;accident,
war, fulfillment of command of political superior
(as by a hangman), self-defense (defense of one's
own life, of others, of property), deliberate or premeditated
killing with its different motives (jealousy, avarice,
revenge, etc.), killing with slight premeditation, from sudden
impulse, from different sorts and degrees of provocation.
To each one of these possible cases is assigned
its exact moral quality, its exact degree of turpitude
and innocency. Nor can this process end with overt acts;
all the inner springs of action which affect regard for life
must be similarly classified: envy, animosity, sudden rage,
sullenness, cherishing of sense of injury, love of tyrannical
power, hardness or hostility, callousness&mdash;all these
must be specified into their different kinds and the exact
moral worth of each determined. What is done for this
one kind of case must be done for every part and phase
of the entire moral life until it is all inventoried, catalogued,
and distributed into pigeon-holes definitely labelled.</p>

<p><b>Dangers of Casuistry.</b>&mdash;Now dangers and evils attend
this way of conceiving the moral life, (a) <i>It tends to
magnify the letter of morality at the expense of its spirit.</i>
It fixes attention not upon the positive good in an act,
not upon the underlying agent's disposition which forms its
spirit, nor upon the unique occasion and context which
form its atmosphere, but upon its literal conformity with
Rule A, Class I., Species 1, sub-head (1), etc. The
effect of this is inevitably to narrow the scope and lessen
the depth of conduct. (i.) It tempts some to hunt for that
classification of their act which will make it the most convenient
or profitable for themselves. In popular speech,
"casuistical" has come to mean a way of judging acts
which splits hairs in the effort to find a way of acting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
that conduces to personal interest and profit, and which
yet may be justified by some moral principle. (ii.) With
others, this regard for the letter makes conduct formal
and pedantic. It gives rise to a rigid and hard type of
character illustrated among the Pharisees of olden and
the Puritans of modern time&mdash;the moral schemes of both
classes being strongly impregnated with the notion of fixed
moral rules.</p>

<p>(b) <i>This ethical system also tends in practice to
a legal view of conduct.</i>&mdash;Historically it always has
sprung from carrying over legal ideas into morality.
In the legal view, liability to blame and to punishment
inflicted from without by some superior authority, is necessarily
prominent. Conduct is regulated through specific
injunctions and prohibitions: Do this, Do not do that.
Exactly the sort of analysis of which we have spoken
above (p. 327) in the case of killing is necessary, so that
there may be definite and regular methods of measuring
guilt and assigning blame. Now the ideas of liability and
punishment and reward are, as we shall see in our further
discussion (chs. xvii. and xxi.), important factors in the
conduct of life, but any scheme of morals is defective
which puts the question of avoiding punishment in the
foreground of attention, and which tends to create a Pharisaical
complacency in the mere fact of having conformed
to command or rule.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Probably the worst evil of this moral system is
that it tends to deprive moral life of freedom and spontaneity</i>
and to reduce it (especially for the conscientious
who take it seriously) to a more or less anxious and
servile conformity to externally imposed rules. Obedience
as loyalty to principle is a good, but this scheme practically
makes it the only good and conceives it not as loyalty
to ideals, but as conformity to commands. Moral
rules exist just as independent deliverances on their own
account, and the right thing is merely to follow them. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
puts the center of moral gravity outside the concrete
processes of living. All systems which emphasize the letter
more than the spirit, legal consequences more than vital
motives, put the individual under the weight of external
authority. They lead to the kind of conduct described by
St. Paul as under the law, not in the spirit, with its constant
attendant weight of anxiety, uncertain struggle,
and impending doom.</p>

<p><b>All Fixed Rules Have Same Tendencies.</b>&mdash;Many who
strenuously object to all of these schemes of conduct, to
everything which hardens it into forms by emphasizing
external commands, authority and punishments and rewards,
fail to see that such evils are logically connected
with any acceptance of the finality of fixed rules. They
hold certain bodies of people, religious officers, political
or legal authorities, responsible for what they object to
in the scheme; while they still cling to the idea that morality
is an effort to apply to particular deeds and projects a
certain number of absolute unchanging moral rules. They
fail to see that, if this were its nature, those who attempt
to provide the machinery which would render it practically
workable deserve praise rather than blame. In fact, the
notion of absolute rules or precepts cannot be made workable
except through certain superior authorities who declare
and enforce them. Said Locke: "It is no small power
it gives one man over another to be the dictator of principles
and teacher of unquestionable truths."</p>

<p><b>II. Utilitarian View of General Rules.</b>&mdash;The utilitarians
escape the difficulties inherent in the application to
particular cases of a rule which has nothing to do with
particular cases. Their principles for judging right and
wrong in particular cases are themselves generalizations
from particular observations of the effect of certain acts
upon happiness and misery. But if we take happiness
in the technical sense of Bentham (as meaning, that is,
an aggregate of isolated pleasures) it is impossible for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
general rules to exist&mdash;there is nothing to generalize.
If, however, we take happiness in its common-sense form,
as welfare, a state of successful achievement, satisfactory
realization of purpose, there can be no doubt of the existence
of maxims and formul&aelig; in which mankind has registered
its experience. The following quotations from Mill
bring out the essential points:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We think utility or happiness much too complex and indefinite
an end to be sought except through the medium of
various secondary ends concerning which there may be, and
often is, agreement among persons who differ in their ultimate
standard; and about which there does in fact prevail a much
greater unanimity among thinking persons, than might be supposed
from their diametrical divergence on the great questions
of moral metaphysics" (<i>Essay on Bentham</i>).</p></div>

<p>These secondary ends or principles are such matters as
regard for health, honesty, chastity, kindness, and the
like. Concerning them he says in his <i>Utilitarianism</i>
(ch. ii.):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mankind must by this time have acquired positive beliefs as
to the effects of some actions on their happiness; and the beliefs
which have thus come down are rules of morality for the
multitude and for the philosopher until he has succeeded in
finding better.... To consider the rules of morality as improvable
is one thing; to pass over the intermediate generalizations
entirely and endeavor to test each individual action
directly by the first principle, is another.... Nobody argues
that the act of navigation is not founded on astronomy,
because sailors cannot wait to calculate the nautical almanac.
Being rational creatures, they go to sea with it already calculated;
and all rational creatures go out upon the sea of life
with their minds made up on the common questions of right
and wrong, as well as on many of the far more difficult questions
of wise and foolish."</p></div>

<p><b>Empirical Rules Run into Fixed Customs.</b>&mdash;It cannot
be denied that Mill here states considerations which are of
great value in aiding present judgments on right and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
wrong. The student of history will have little doubt that
the rules of conduct which the intuitionalist takes as ultimate
deliverances of a moral faculty are in truth generalizations
of the sort indicated by Mill. But the truth
brought out by Mill does not cover the ground which
needs to be covered. Such rules at best cover customary
elements; they are based upon past habits of life, past
natural economic and political environments. And, as the
student of customs knows, greater store is often set upon
trivial, foolish, and even harmful things than upon serious
ones&mdash;upon fashions of hair-dressing, ablutions, worship
of idols. Coming nearer our own conditions, past customs
certainly tolerate and sanction many practices, such
as war, cruel business competition, economic exploitation
of the weak, and absence of co&ouml;perative intelligent foresight,
which the more sensitive consciences of the day will
not approve.</p>

<p><b>Hence are Unsatisfactory.</b>&mdash;Yet such things have been
so identified with happiness that to forego them means
misery, to alter them painful disturbance. To take the
rules of the past with any literalness as criteria of judgment
in the present, would be to return to the unprogressive
morality of the r&eacute;gime of custom&mdash;to surrender
the advance marked by reflective morality. Since Bentham
and Mill were both utilitarians, it is worth noting that
Bentham insisted upon the utilitarian standard just because
he was so convinced of the unsatisfactory character
of the kind of rules upon which Mill is dwelling. The
"Nautical Almanac" has been <i>scientifically</i> calculated; it
is adapted rationally to its end; but the rules which sum
up custom are a confused mixture of class interest, irrational
sentiment, authoritative pronunciamento, and genuine
consideration of welfare.</p>

<p><b>Empirical Rules Also Differ Widely.</b>&mdash;The fact is,
moreover, that it is only when the "intermediate generalizations"
are taken vaguely and abstractly that there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
as much agreement as Mill claims. All educated and
virtuous persons in the same country practically agree
upon the rules of justice, benevolence, and regard for life,
so long as they are taken in such a vague way that they
mean anything in general and nothing in particular.
Every one is in favor of justice in the abstract; but existing
political and economic discussions regarding tariff,
sumptuary laws, monetary standards, trades unions,
trusts, the relation of capital and labor, the regulation
or ownership of public utilities, the nationalization of land
and industry, show that large bodies of intelligent and
equally well-disposed people are quite capable of finding
that the principle of justice requires exactly opposite
things.</p>

<p>Custom still forms the background of all moral life,
nor can we imagine a state of affairs in which it should
not. Customs are not external to individuals' courses
of action; they are embodied in the habits and purposes
of individuals; in the words of Grote (quoted above, p.
173), they "reign under the appearance of habitual, <i>self-suggested</i>
tendencies." Laws, formulated and unformulated,
social conventions, rules of manners, the general
expectations of public opinion, are all of them sources
of instruction regarding conduct. Without them the
individual would be practically helpless in determining the
right courses of action in the various situations in which
he finds himself. Through them he has provided himself
in advance with a list of questions, an organized series of
points-of-view, by which to approach and estimate each
state of affairs requiring action. Most of the moral judgments
of every individual are framed in this way.</p>

<p><b>For Customs Conflict.</b>&mdash;If social customs, or individual
habits, never conflicted with one another, this sort
of guidance would suffice for the determination of right
and wrong. But reflection is necessitated because opposite
habits set up incompatible ends, forms of happiness be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>tween
which choice has to be made. Hence the need of
<i>principles in judging</i>. Principles of judgment cannot
simply reinstate past rules of behavior, for the simple reason
that as long as these rules suffice there is no reflection
and no demand for principles. Good and evil, right and
wrong, are embodied in the injunctions and prohibitions of
customs and institutions and are not thought about.</p>

<p><b>Moral Import of Principles is Intellectual, Not Imperative.</b>&mdash;This
brings us to the essential point in the consideration
of the value of general principles. <i>Rules are
practical; they are habitual ways of doing things. But
principles are intellectual; they are useful methods of
judging things.</i> The fundamental error of the intuitionalist
and of the utilitarian (represented in the quotation
from Mill) is that they are on the lookout for rules which
will of themselves tell agents just what course of action to
pursue; <i>whereas the object of moral principles is to supply
standpoints and methods which will enable the individual to
make for himself an analysis of the elements of good and
evil in the particular situation in which he finds himself</i>.
No genuine moral principle prescribes a specific course of
action; rules<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> like cooking recipes, may tell just what to
do and how to do it. A moral principle, such as that of
chastity, of justice, of the golden rule, gives the agent a
basis for looking at and examining a particular question
that comes up. It holds before him certain possible aspects
of the act; it warns him against taking a short or
partial view of the act. It economizes his thinking by
supplying him with the main heads by reference to which
to consider the bearings of his desires and purposes; it
guides him in his thinking by suggesting to him the important
considerations for which he should be on the
lookout.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Golden Rule as a Tool of Analysis.</b>&mdash;A moral principle,
then, is not a command to act or forbear acting in a given
way: <i>it is a tool for analyzing a special situation</i>, the right
or wrong being determined by the situation in its entirety,
and not by the rule as such. We sometimes hear it stated,
for example, that the universal adoption of the Golden
Rule would at once settle all industrial disputes and difficulties.
But supposing that the principle were accepted in
good faith by everybody; it would not at once tell everybody
just what to do in all the complexities of his relations
to others. When individuals are still uncertain of what
their real good may be, it does not finally decide matters
to tell them to regard the good of others as they would
their own. Nor does it mean that whatever in detail we
want for ourselves we should strive to give to others.
Because I am fond of classical music it does not follow that
I should thrust as much of it as possible upon my neighbors.
But the "Golden Rule" does furnish us a <i>point
of view from which to consider acts</i>; it suggests the necessity
of considering how our acts affect the interests of
others as well as our own; it tends to prevent partiality
of regard; it warns against setting an undue estimate
upon a particular consequence of pain or pleasure, simply
because it happens to affect us. In short, the Golden Rule
does not issue special orders or commands; but it does
simplify judgment of the situations requiring intelligent
deliberation.</p>

<p><b>Sympathy as Actuating Principle of a Reasonable
Judgment.</b>&mdash;We have had repeated occasion (as in the
discussion of intent and motive, of intuition and deliberate
calculation) to see how artificial is the separation of emotion
and thought from one another. As the only effective
thought is one fused by emotion into a dominant interest,
so the only truly general, the reasonable as distinct
from the merely shrewd or clever thought, is the <i>generous</i>
thought.  Sympathy widens our interest in consequences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
and leads us to take into account such results as affect
the welfare of others; it aids us to count and weigh these
consequences as counting for as much as those which touch
our own honor, purse, or power. To put ourselves in the
place of another, to see from the standpoint of his purposes
and values, to humble our estimate of our own claims
and pretensions to the level they would assume in the
eyes of a sympathetic and impartial observer, is the surest
way to attain universality and objectivity of moral knowledge.
Sympathy, in short, is the general principle of
moral knowledge, not because its commands take precedence
of others (which they do not necessarily), but because
it furnishes the most reliable and efficacious <i>intellectual</i>
standpoint. It supplies the tool, <i>par excellence</i>, for
analyzing and resolving complex cases. As was said in
our last chapter, it is the <i>fusion</i> of the sympathetic impulses
with others that is needed; what we now add is
that in this fusion, sympathy supplies the <i>pou sto</i> for an
effective, broad, and objective survey of desires, projects,
resolves, and deeds. It translates the formal and empty
reason of Kant out of its abstract and theoretic character,
just as it carries the cold calculations of utilitarianism
into recognition of the common good.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XVII</small>

<br /><br />

THE PLACE OF DUTY IN THE MORAL LIFE:
SUBJECTION TO AUTHORITY</h2>


<p><b>Conflict of Ends as Attractive and as Reasonable.</b>&mdash;The
previous discussion has brought out the contrast between
a Good or Satisfaction which is such <i>directly</i>,
immediately, by appealing attractively to desire; and
one which is such indirectly, through considerations which
reflection brings up. As we have seen, the latter must,
if entertained at all, arouse some direct emotional response,
must be felt to be in some way satisfactory. But the
<i>way</i> may be quite unlike that of the end which attracts
and holds a man irrespective of the principle brought
to light by reflection. The one may be intense, vivid,
absorbing, passing at once into overt action, unless
checked by a contrary reason. The good whose claim to
be good depends mainly on projection of remote considerations,
may be theoretically recognized and yet the direct
appeal to the particular agent at the particular time be
feeble and pallid. The "law of the mind" may assert itself
less urgently than the "law of the members" which wars
against it.</p>

<p><b>Two Senses of Term Duty.</b>&mdash;This contrast gives rise
to the fact of Duty. On one side is the rightful supremacy
of the reasonable but remote good; on the other side is
the aversion of those springs to action which are immediately
most urgent. Between them exists the necessity
of securing for the reasonable good efficacy in operation;
or the necessity of redirecting the play of naturally
dominant desires. Duty is also used, to be sure, in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
looser and more external sense. To identify the dutiful
with the right apart from conflict, to say that a man did
his duty, may mean that he did right, irrespective of the
prior state of his inclinations. It frequently happens
that the wider and larger good which is developed through
reflective memory and foresight is welcomed, is directly
appreciated as good, since it is thoroughly attractive.
Without stress and strain, without struggle, it just displaces
the object which unreflective impulse had suggested.
It is the fit and proper, the only sensible and
wise thing, under the circumstances. The man does his
duty, but is glad to do it, and would be troubled by the
thought of another line of action. So far as calling the
act "duty" brings in any new meaning, it means that the
right act is one which is found to meet the demands, the
necessities, of the situation in which it takes place. The
Romans thus spoke of duties as <i>offices</i>, the performance
of those functions which are appropriate to the status
which every person occupies because of his social relations.</p>

<p><b>Conscious Conflict.</b>&mdash;But there are other cases in which
the <i>right</i> end is distinctly apprehended by the person
as standing in opposition to his natural inclinations, as
a principle or law which <i>ought</i> to be followed, but which
<i>can</i> be followed only by constraining the inclinations, by
snubbing and coercing them. This state of affairs is
well represented by the following quotation from Matthew
Arnold, if we take it as merely describing the facts, not
as implying a theory as to their explanation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All experience with conduct brings us at last to the fact
of two selves, or instincts, or forces&mdash;name them, however
we may and however we may suppose them to have arisen&mdash;contending
for the mastery over men: one, a movement of
first impulse and more involuntary, leading us to gratify any
inclination that may solicit us and called generally a movement
of man's ordinary or passing self, of sense, appetite,
desire; the other a movement of reflection and more voluntary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
leading us to submit inclination to some rule, and called generally
a movement of man's higher or enduring self, of reason,
spirit, will."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p></div>

<p>We shall (I.) present what we consider the true account
of this situation of conflict in which the sense of duty
is found; (II.) turn to explanations which are one-sided,
taking up (1) the intuitive, (2) the utilitarian theory;
and finally (III.) return with the results of this criticism
to a restatement of our own theory.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. THE SUBJECTION OF DESIRE TO LAW</h4>

<p>Ordinary language sets before us some main facts:
duty suggests what is due, a debt to be paid; ought is
connected with owe; obligation implies being bound to
something&mdash;as we speak of "bounden duty." We speak
naturally of "meeting obligations"; of duties being "imposed,"
"laid upon" one. The person who is habitually
careless about his duties is "unruly" or "lawless"; one
who evades or refuses them is "unprincipled." These ideas
suggest there is something required, exacted, having the
sanction of law, or a regular and regulative principle;
and imply natural aversion to the requirements exacted, a
preference for something else. Hence duty as a conscious
factor means constraint of inclination; an unwillingness or
reluctance which <i>should</i> be overcome but which it is difficult
to surmount, requiring an effort which only adequate
recognition of the rightful supremacy of the dutiful end
will enable one to put forth. Thus we speak of interest
conflicting with principle, and desire with duty. While
they are inevitably bound together, it will be convenient to
discuss separately (1) Inclination and impulse as averse to
duty, and (2) Duty as having authority, as expressing
law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p><b>1. Inclination Averse to Duty.</b>&mdash;Directly and indirectly,
all desires root in certain fundamental organic
wants and appetites. Conduct, behavior, implies a living
organism. If this organism were not equipped with an
intense instinctive tendency to keep itself going, to sustain
itself, it would soon cease to be amid the menaces,
difficulties, rebuffs, and failures of life. Life means appetites,
like hunger, thirst, sex; instincts like anger, fear,
and hope, which are almost imperious in their struggles
for satisfaction. They do not arise from reflection, but
antedate it; their existence does not depend upon consideration
of consequences, but their existence it is which tends
to call out reflection. Their very presence in a healthy
organism means a certain reservoir of energy which overflows
almost spontaneously. They are impulsive. Such
tendencies, then, constitute an essential and fundamental
part of the capacities of a person; their realization is
involved in one's happiness. In all this there is nothing
abnormal nor immoral. But a human being is something
more than a mere demand for the satisfaction of instincts
of food, sex, and protection. If we admit (as the theory
of organic evolution requires) that all other desires and
purposes are <i>ultimately</i> derived from these tendencies of
the organism, still it is true that the refined and highly
developed forms exist side by side with crude, organic
forms, and that the simultaneous satisfaction of the two
types, just as they stand, is impossible.</p>

<p><b>Organic and Reflectively Formed Tendencies Conflict.</b>&mdash;Even
if it be true, as it may well be, that the desires and
purposes connected with property were developed out
of instincts having to do with food for self and offspring,
it is still true that the developed desires do not wholly
displace those out of which they developed. The presence
of the purposes elaborated by thought side by side
with the more organic demands causes strife and the
need of resolution. The accumulation of property may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>involve subordinating the immediate urgency of hunger;
property as an institution implies that one is not free
to satisfy his appetite just as he pleases, but may have
to postpone or forego satisfaction, because the food supply
belongs to another; or that he can satisfy hunger only
through some labor which in itself is disagreeable to him.
Similarly the family springs originally out of the instinct
of reproduction. But the purposes and plans which
go with family life are totally inconsistent with the mere
gratification of sexual desire in its casual and spontaneous
appearance. The refined, highly developed, and complex
purposes exact a checking, a regulation and subordination
of inclinations as they first spring up&mdash;a
control to which the inclinations are not of themselves
prone and against which they may rebelliously assert
themselves.</p>

<p><b>Duty May Reside on the More Impulsive Side.</b>&mdash;It
would be a great mistake, however, to limit the need
of subordination simply to the unruly agencies of appetite.
Habits which have been consciously or reflectively
formed, even when in their original formation these habits
had the sanction and approval of reason, require control.
The habits of a professional man, of an investigator, or
a lawyer, for example, have been formed through careful
and persistent reflection directed upon ends adjudged
right. Virtues of painstaking industry, of perseverance,
have been formed; untimely and unseemly desires have
been checked. But as an outcome these habits, and the
desires and purposes that express them, have perhaps
become all-engrossing. Occupation is preoccupation. It
encroaches upon the attention needed for other concerns.
The skill gained tends to shut the individual up to narrow
matters and to shut out other "universes" of good which
should be desired. Domestic and civic responsibilities are
perhaps felt to be insignificant details or irritating burdens
unworthy of attention. Thus a reflective habit, legiti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>mate
in itself, right in its right place, may give rise to
desires and ends which involve a corrosive selfishness.</p>

<p>Moreover, that the insubordination does not reside in
appetites or impulses just as appetites and impulses, is
seen in the fact that duty may lie on the side of a purpose
connected with them, and be asserted against the force of
a habit formed under the supervision of thought. The
student or artist may find his pursuit makes him averse to
satisfying the needful claims of hunger and healthy exercise.
The prudent business man may find himself undutifully
cold to the prompting of an impulse of pity;
the student of books or special intellectual or artistic
ends may find duty on the side of some direct human
impulse.</p>

<p><b>Statement of Problem.</b>&mdash;Such considerations show that
we cannot attribute the conflict of duty and inclination
simply to the existence of appetites and unreflective impulses,
as if these were in and of themselves opposed to
regulation by any principle. We must seek for an explanation
which will apply equally to appetites and to
habits of thought. What is there common to the situations
of him who feels it his duty to check the satisfaction of
strong hunger until others have been properly served, and
of the scientific investigator who finds it his duty to check
the exercise of his habit of thinking in order that he may
satisfy the demands of his body?</p>

<p><b>Statement of Explanation.</b>&mdash;Any habit, like any appetite
or instinct, represents something formed, set; whether
this has occurred in the history of the race or of the
individual makes little difference to its established urgency.
Habit is second, if not first, nature. (1) Habit represents
<i>facilities</i>; what is set, organized, is relatively easy. It
<i>marks the line of least resistance</i>. A habit of reflection,
so far as it is a specialized habit, is as easy and natural
to follow as an organic appetite. (2) Moreover, the exercise
of any easy, frictionless habit is pleasurable.  It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
is a commonplace that use and wont deprive situations of
originally disagreeable features. (3) Finally, a formed
habit is an active <i>tendency</i>. It only needs an appropriate
stimulus to set it going; frequently the mere absence
of any strong obstacle serves to release its pent-up energy.
It is a propensity to act in a certain way whenever opportunity
presents. Failure to function is uncomfortable and
arouses feelings of irritation or lack.</p>

<p>Reluctance to the right end, an aversion requiring to
be overcome, if at all, by recognition of the superior value
of the right end, is then to be accounted for <i>on the
ground of the inertia or momentum of any organized,
established tendency</i>. This momentum gives the common
ground to instinctive impulses and deliberately formed
habits. The momentum represents the <i>old</i>, an adaptation
to familiar, customary conditions. So far as similar
conditions recur, the formed power functions economically
and effectively, supplying ease, promptness, certainty, and
agreeableness to the execution of an act.</p>

<p>But if new, changed conditions require a serious readjustment
of the old habit or appetite, the natural tendency
will be to resist this demand. Thus we have precisely
the traits of reluctance and constraint which mark
the consciousness of duty. A self without habits, one loose
and fluid, in which change in one direction is just as easy
as in another, would not have the sense of duty. A self
with no new possibilities, rigidly set in conditions and perfectly
accommodated to them, would not have it. But
definite, persistent, urgent tendencies to act in a given way,
occurring at the same time with other incompatible tendencies
which represent the self more adequately and yet
are not organized into habits, afford the conditions of the
sense of restraint. If for any reason the unorganized
tendency is judged to be the truer expression of self, we
have also the sense of lawful constraint. <i>The constraint
of appetite and desire is a phenomenon of practical read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>justment,
within the structure of character, due to conflict
of tendencies so irreconcilable in their existing forms
as to demand radical redirection.</i></p>

<p>When an appetite is in accord with those habits of
an individual which enable him to perform his social
functions, or which naturally accrue from his social relations,
it is legitimate and good; when it conflicts, it is
illicit, it is lust; we call it by hard names and we demand
that it be curbed; we regard its force as a menace to
the integrity of the agent and a threat to social order.
When the reflective habits of an individual come into
conflict with natural appetites and impulses, the manifestation
of which would enlarge or make more certain
the powers of the individual in his full relations to others,
it is the reflective habits which have to be held in and
redirected at the cost of whatever disagreeableness.</p>

<p><b>(2) The Authority of Duty.</b>&mdash;A duty, in Kant's words,
is a <i>categorical</i> imperative&mdash;it claims the absolute right
of way as against immediate inclination. That which, on
one side, is the constraint of natural desire, is, on the
other, the authoritative claim of the right end to regulate.
Over against the course of action most immediately urgent,
most easy and comfortable, so congenial as at once
to motivate action unless checked, stands another course,
representing a wider and more far-reaching point of
view, and hence furnishing the rational end of the situation.
However lacking in intensity, however austere this
end, it stands for the whole self, and is therefore felt to
be rightly supreme over any partial tendency. But since
it looks to realization in an uncertain future, rather than
permission just to let go what is most urgent at the moment,
it requires effort, hard work, work of attention more
or less repulsive and uncongenial. Hence that sense of
stress and strain, of being pulled one way by inclination
and another by the claims of right, so characteristic of
an experience of obligation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Social Character of Duties.</b>&mdash;But this statement describes
the experience only on its formal side. In the concrete,
that end which possesses claim to regulate desire is
the one which grows out of the social position or function
of the agent, out of <i>a course of action to which he is committed
by a regular, socially established connection between
himself and others</i>. The man who has assumed the position
of a husband and a parent has by that very fact
entered upon a <i>line</i> of action, something continuous, running
far into the future; something so fundamental that
it modifies and pervades his other activities, requiring them
to be co&ouml;rdinated or rearranged from its point of view.
The same thing holds, of course, of the calling of a doctor,
a lawyer, a merchant, a banker, a judge, or other officer
of the State. Each social calling implies a continuous,
regular mode of action, binding together into a whole a
multitude of acts occurring at different times, and giving
rise to definite expectations and demands on the part of
others. Every relationship in life, is, as it were, <i>a tacit
or expressed contract with others</i>, committing one, by the
simple fact that he occupies that relationship, to a corresponding
mode of action. Every one, willy-nilly, occupies
a social position; if not a parent, he is a child; if not
an officer, then a citizen of the State; if not pursuing an
occupation, he is in preparation for an occupation, or
else is living upon the results of the labors of others.</p>

<p><b>Connection with Selfhood.</b>&mdash;Every one, in short, is in
<i>general relations to others</i>,&mdash;relationships which enter so
internally and so intimately into the very make-up of his
being that he is not morally free to pick and choose, saying,
this good is really my affair, that other one not. The
mode of action which is required by the fact that the
person is a member of a complex social network is a more
final expression of his own nature than is the temporarily
intense instinctive appetite, or the habit which has become
"second nature." It is not for the individual to say, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
latter is attractive and therefore really mine, while the
former is repellant and therefore an alien intruder, to
be surrendered to only if it cannot be evaded. From this
point of view, the conflict of desire and duty, of interest
and principle, expresses itself as a conflict between tendencies
which have got organized into one's <i>fixed character</i>
and which therefore appeal to him just as he is; and those
tendencies which relate to the development of a larger
self, a self which should take fuller account of social relations.
The Kantian theory emphasizes the fact brought
out above: <i>viz.</i>, that duty represents the authority of an
act expressing the reasonable and "universal" self over
a casual and partial self; while the utilitarian theory emphasizes
the part played by social institutions and demands
in creating and enforcing both special duties and the
sense of duty in general.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. KANTIAN THEORY</h4>

<p><b>"Accord with" Duty versus "from" Duty.</b>&mdash;Kant
points out that acts may be "in accordance with duty"
and yet not be done "from duty." "It is always, for example,
a matter of duty that a dealer should not overcharge
an inexperienced purchaser, and wherever there is
much commerce the prudent tradesman does not overcharge....
Men are thus honestly served; but this is
not enough to prove that the tradesman so acted from duty
and from principles of honesty; his own advantage required
it" (<i>Kant's Theory of Ethics</i>, Abbott's translation,
p. 13). In such a case the act externally viewed is in <i>accordance</i>
with duty; morally viewed, it proceeds from selfish
calculation of personal profit, not from duty. This is
true in general of all acts which, though outwardly right,
spring from considerations of expediency, and are based
on the consideration that "honesty (or whatever) is the
best policy." Persons are naturally inclined to take care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
of their health, their property, their children, or whatever
belongs to them. Such acts, no matter how much they
accord with duty, are not done <i>from duty</i>, but from inclination.
If a man is suffering, unfortunate, desirous
of death, and yet cherishes his life with no love for it, but
from the duty to do so, his motive has truly moral value.
So if a mother cares for her child, <i>because</i> she recognizes
that it is her duty, the act is truly moral.</p>

<p><b>From Duty alone Moral.</b>&mdash;According to Kant, then,
acts alone have moral import that are consciously performed
"from duty," that is, with recognition of its authority
as their animating spring. "<i>The idea of good and
evil (in their moral sense) must not be determined before
the moral law, but only after it and by means of it</i>" (<i>Ibid.</i>,
p. 154). All our desires and inclinations seek naturally
for an <i>end</i> which is good&mdash;for happiness, success,
achievement. No one of them nor all of them put together,
then, can possibly supply the motive of acting <i>from</i>
duty. Hence duty and its authority must spring
from another source, from reason itself, which supplies
the consciousness of a law which <i>ought</i> to be the motive
of every act, whether it is or not. The utilitarians completely
reverse the truth of morals when they say that the
idea of the good end comes first and the "right" is that
which realizes the good end.</p>

<p><b>Dual Constitution of Man.</b>&mdash;We are all familiar with
the notion that man has a dual constitution; that he is
a creature both of sense and spirit; that he has a carnal
and an ideal nature; a lower and a higher self, a self of
appetite and of reason. Now Kant's theory of duty is a
peculiar version of this common notion. Man's special ends
and purposes all spring from desires and inclinations.
These are all for personal happiness and hence without
moral worth. They form man's sensuous, appetitive nature,
which if not "base" in itself easily becomes so,
because it struggles with principle for the office of supply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>ing
motives for action. The principle of a law absolutely
binding, requires the complete expulsion of the claim of
desires to <i>motivate</i> action. (See <i>Kant's Theory</i>, pp. 70-79;
132-136; 159-163.) If a man were an animal, he
would have only appetite to follow; if he were a god or
angel, he would have only reason. Being man, being a
peculiar compound of sense and reason, he has put upon
him the problem of resisting the natural prompting of
inclination and of accepting the duty of acting from
reverence for duty.</p>

<p><b>Criticism of Kant's Theory.</b>&mdash;There is an undoubted
fact back of Kant's conception which gives it whatever
plausibility it has&mdash;the fact that inclinations which are
not necessarily evil tend to claim a controlling position, a
claim which has to be resisted. The peculiarity of Kant's
interpretation lies in its complete and final separation of
the two aspects, "higher" and "lower," the appetitive and
rational, of man's nature, and it is upon this separation,
accordingly, that our discussion will be directed.</p>

<p><b>I. Duty and the Affections.</b>&mdash;In the first place, Kant's
absolute separation of sense or appetite from reason and
duty, because of its necessary disparagement of the affections
leads to a formal and pedantic view of morality.
It is one thing to say that desire as it <i>first</i> shows itself
<i>sometimes</i> prompts to a morally inadequate end; it is quite
another thing to say that <i>any</i> acceptance of an end of
desire as a motive is morally wrong&mdash;that the act to be
right must be first brought under a conscious acknowledgment
of some law or principle. Only the exigencies of a
ready-made theory would lead any one to think that habitual
purposes that express the habitually dominant tendencies
and powers of the agent, may not suffice to keep
morally sound the main tenor of behavior; that it is impossible
for regard for right ends to become organized
into character and to be fused into working unity with
natural impulses. Only a metaphysical theory regarding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
the separation of sense and reason in man leads to the
denial of this fact.</p>

<p>Between the merchant who is honest in his weights and
fixed in his prices merely because he calculates that such a
course is to his own advantage, and the merchant (if such
a person could exist) who should never sell a spool of thread
or a paper of pins without having first reminded himself
that his ultimate motive for so doing was respect for
the law of duty, there is the ordinary merchant who is
honest because he has the desires characteristic of an honest
man. Schiller has made fun of the artificial stringency
of Kant's theory in some verses which represent a disciple
coming to Kant with his perplexity:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Willingly serve I my friends, but I do it, alas with affection.<br />
Hence I am plagued with this doubt, virtue I have not attained!"<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">to which he received the reply:</p>

<p class="poem">
"This is your only resource, you must stubbornly seek to abhor them;<br />
Then you can do with disgust that which the law may enjoin."<br />
</p>

<p>These verses are a caricature of Kant's position; he
does not require that affections should be crushed, but that
they should be stamped with acknowledgment of law before
being accepted as motives. But the verses bring out
the absurd element in the notion that the affections and
inclinations may not of themselves be morally adequate
springs to action,&mdash;as if a man could not eat his dinner
simply because he was hungry, or be amiable to a companion
because he wanted to be, or relieve distress because
his compassionate nature urged him to it.</p>

<p>It is worth while noting that some moralists have gone
to the opposite extreme and have held that an act is not
right unless it expresses the overflowing spontaneity of the
affections; that a man's act is only imperfectly right when
he performs it not from affection, but from coercion by
duty. Thus Emerson speaks of men who "do by knowledge
what the stones do by structure." And again, "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
love characters in proportion as they are impulsive and
spontaneous. When we see a soul whose acts are all regal,
graceful, and pleasant as roses, we must thank God that
such things can be and are, and not turn sourly on the
angel and say, 'Crump is a better man with his grunting
resistance to all his native devils.'" The facts seem to be
that while, in a good man, natural impulses and formed
habits are adequate motive powers under ordinary conditions,
there are times when an end, somewhat weak in
its motive force because it does not express an habitually
dominant power of the self, needs to be re&euml;nforced by
associations which have gathered at all periods of his
past around the experience of good. There is a certain
reservoir of emotional force which, while far from
fluid, is capable of transfer and application, especially
in a conscientious person. Kant criticizes the moral
sense theory on the ground that "in order to imagine
the vicious man tormented with a sense of his transgressions,
it must first represent him as morally good in the
main trend of his character" (Abbott, p. 128). Well, a
man who is capable of making appeal to the sense of duty
in general, is the one in whom love of good is already
dominant.</p>

<p><b>II. Tendency to Fanaticism and Idealization of Authority.</b>&mdash;Kant's
theory of fixed and final separation
between desire and reason leads us into a fatal dilemma;
either a right end is impossible, or any end is right
provided we fall back on a belief that it is our duty
to perform it. Kant holds that every concrete end,
every definite purpose which we entertain, comes from
desire. Law utters no specific command except "do your
duty"; it stamps an end of desire as right only when it is
pursued, not because it is an end of desire, but "from
duty." The actual end which is before us is, in any
case, supplied through inclination and desire. Reason
furnishes <i>principle</i> as a <i>motive</i>. We have here, in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>other
form, the separation of end and motive which has
already occupied us (p. 248). End and motive are so
disconnected, so irrelevant to one another, that we have
no alternative except either to condemn every end, because,
being prompted by desire, it falls so far short of
the majesty of duty; or else fanatically to persist in any
course when once we have formally brought it under the
notion of duty.</p>

<p>The latter alternative would be the one chosen by a truly
Kantian agent because it is alone possible in practice.
But the moral fanatic does about as much evil in the world
as the man of no moral principle. Religious wars, persecutions,
intolerance, harsh judgment of others, obstinate
persistence in a course of action once entered upon in spite
of the testimony of experience to the harm that results;
blind devotion to narrow and one-sided aims; deliberate
opposition to art, culture, social amenities, recreations, or
whatever the "man of principle" happens to find obnoxious:
pharisaical conviction of superiority, of being the
peculiar, chosen instrument of the moral law;&mdash;these and
the countless ills that follow in their wake, are inevitable effects
of erecting the isolated conviction of duty into a sufficient
motive of action. So far as these evils do not
actually flow from an acceptance of the Kantian principle,
it is because that has been promulgated and for the most
part adopted, where reverence for authority and law is
strong. In Germany the Kantian philosophy has, upon
the whole, served as a help in criticizing law and procedure
on the basis of their rationality, while it has also served
as a convenient stamp of rational sanction upon a politically
authoritative r&eacute;gime, already fairly reasonable, as
such matters go, in the content of its legislation and
administration.</p>

<p><b>III. Meaning of Duty for Duty's Sake.</b>&mdash;It is a sound
principle to do our duty <i>as</i> our duty, and not for the sake
of something else. "Duty for duty's sake" means, in truth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
<i>an act for the act's own sake</i>; the gift of cold water, the
word of encouragement, the sweeping of the room, the
learning of the lesson, the selling of the goods, the painting
of the picture, because they are the things really
called for at a given time, and hence their own excuses
for being. <i>No moral act is a means to anything beyond
itself,&mdash;not even to morality.</i> But, upon Kant's theory,
duty for duty's sake means a special act not for its own
sake, but for the sake of abstract principle. Just as the
hedonists regard a special act as a mere means to happiness,
so Kant makes the concrete act a mere means to virtue.
As there is a "hedonistic paradox," namely that the
way to get happiness is to forget it, to devote ourselves
to things and persons about us; so there is a "moralistic"
paradox, that the way to get goodness is to cease to think
of it&mdash;as something separate&mdash;and to devote ourselves to
the realization of the full value of the practical situations
in which we find ourselves. Men can really think of their
"duty" only when they are thinking of specific things to
be done; to think of Duty at large or in the abstract is
one of the best ways of avoiding doing it, or of doing it in
a partial and perverted way.</p>

<p><b>Summary of Criticism of Kant.</b>&mdash;To sum up, the
theory which regards duty as having its source in a
rational self which is independent of and above the self
of inclination and affection (1) deprives the habitual
desires and affections, which make the difference between
one concrete character and another, of moral significance;
(2) commits us to an unenlightened performance of what
is called duty irrespective of its real goodness; and (3)
makes moral principle a remote abstraction, instead of the
vivifying soul of a concrete deed. Its strongest point, its
insistence upon the <i>autonomous</i> character of duty, or that
duty is organically connected with the self in some of
its phases or functions, will appear more clearly as we contrast
it with the utilitarian theory.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 3. THE UTILITARIAN THEORY OF DUTY</h4>

<p><b>Problem of Duty on Hedonistic Basis.</b>&mdash;The utilitarians'
explanation of the constraint of desire by the authority
of right is framed to meet the peculiar difficulty
in which their hedonistic theory places them. If pleasure
is the good, and if all desire is naturally for the good, why
should desire have to be constrained? How can such a
thing as "duty" exist at all? For to say that a man is
obliged or bound to seek that which he just can't help
seeking is absurd. There is, according to the utilitarian,
a difference, however, between the pleasure which is the
object of desire and that which is the standard of judgment.
The former is the person's own pleasure; it is
private. The happiness which measures the rightness
of the act is that of all persons who are affected by it. In
view of this divergence, there must, if right action is to
occur, be agencies which operate upon the individual so as
to make him find his personal pleasure in that which
conduces to the general welfare. These influences
are the expectations and demands of <i>others so far as
they attach consequences in the way of punishment, of
suffering, and of reward and pleasure, to the deeds of an
individual</i>.</p>

<p>In this way the natural inclination of an individual towards
a certain pleasure, or his natural revulsion from a
certain pain, may be checked and transformed by recognition
that if he seeks the pleasure, others will inflict more
than an equivalent pain, or if he bears the pain, others will
reward him with more than compensating pleasures. In
such cases, we have the fact of duty or obligation. There
is constraint of first inclination through recognition of
superior power, this power being asserted in its expressly
declared intention of rewarding and penalizing according
as its prescriptions are or are not followed. These
are the factors: (1) demands, expectations, rules exter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>nally
imposed; (2) consequences in the way of proffered
reward of pleasure, and penalty of pain; (3) resulting
constraint of the natural manifestation of desires. In the
main, the theory is based on the analogy of legal obligations.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p><b>(a) Bentham's Account.</b>&mdash;Bentham dislikes the very
word duty; and speaks preferably of the "sanctions"
of an act. The following quotations will serve to confirm
the foregoing statements.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The happiness of the individuals of whom a community is
composed is ... the sole standard, in conformity to which
each individual <i>ought</i> to be made to fashion his behavior. But
whether it be this, or anything else that is to be done, there
is nothing by which a man can ultimately be <i>made</i> to do it,
but either pain or pleasure."</p></div>

<p>A kind of pain or pleasure which tends to <i>make</i> an individual
find his own good in the good of the community is
a <i>sanction</i>. Of these Bentham mentions four kinds, of
which the first alone is not due to the will of others, but
is <i>physical</i>. Thus the individual may check his inclination
to drink by a thought of the ills that flow from drunkenness.
Metaphorically, then, he may be said to have a duty
not to drink; strictly speaking, however, this is his own
obvious interest. The sanctions proper are (a) political,
consequences in the way of pleasure and pain (especially
pain) attached to injunctions and prohibitions by a legal
superior; (b) popular, the consequences following from
the more indefinite influence of public opinion&mdash;such as
being "sent to Coventry," being shunned, rendered unpopular,
losing reputation, or honor, etc.; and (3) religious,
penalties of hell and rewards of heaven attached to
action by a divine being, or similar penances and rewards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
by the representatives on earth (church, priests, etc.) of
this divine being.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p><b>Value and Deficiencies of This View.</b>&mdash;The strong
point of this explanation of duty is obviously that it recognizes
the large, the very large, r&ocirc;le played by social institutions,
regulations, and demands in bringing home to a
person the fact that certain acts, whether he is naturally
so inclined or not, should be performed. But its
weak point is that it tends to identify duty with coercion;
to change the "ought" if not into a physical "must," at
least into the psychological "must" of fear of pain and
hope of pleasure. Hope of reward and fear of penalty
are real enough motives in human life; but acts performed
mainly or solely on their account do not, in the
unprejudiced judgment of mankind, rank very high morally.
Habitually to appeal to such motives is rather
to weaken than to strengthen the tendencies in the individual
which make for right action. The difficulty
lies clearly in the purely <i>external</i> character of the "sanctions,"
and this in turn is due to the fact that the obligations
imposed by the demands and expectancies of others
do not have any intrinsic connection with the character
of the individual of whom they are exacted. They are
wholly external burdens and impositions.</p>

<p>The individual, with his desires and his pleasures, being
made up out of particular states of feeling, is complete in
himself. Social relationships must then be alien and external;
if they modify in any way the existing body of feelings
they are artificial constraints. One individual merely
<i>happens</i> to live side by side with other individuals, who are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
in themselves isolated, and are complete in their isolation.
If their external acts conflict, it may be necessary to
invade and change the body of feelings which make up the
self from which the act flows. Hence duty.</p>

<p>The later development of utilitarianism tended to get
away from this psychical and atomic individualism; and to
conceive the good of an individual as including <i>within</i> himself
relations to others. So far as this was done, the demands
of others, public opinion, laws, etc., became factors
<i>in the development of the individual, and in arousing him
to an adequate sense of what his good is, and of interest
in effecting it</i>. Later utilitarianism dwells less than Bentham
upon external sanctions, and more upon an unconscious
shaping of the individual's character and motives
through imitation, education, and all the agencies which
mould the individual's desires into natural agreement with
the social type. While it is John Stuart Mill who insists
most upon the internal and qualitative change of disposition
that thus takes place,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> it is Bain and Spencer who
give the most detailed account of the methods by which
it is brought about.</p>

<p><b>(b) Bain's Account.</b>&mdash;His basis agrees with Bentham's:
"The proper meaning, or import, of the terms (duty, obligation)
refers to that class of action which is enforced by
the sanction of punishment" (Bain, <i>Emotions and Will</i>,
p. 286). But he sets less store by political legislation and
the force of vague public opinion, and more by the gradual
and subtle processes of family education. The lesson of
obedience, that there are things to be done whether one
wishes or no, is impressed upon the child almost unremittingly
from the very first moment of life. There are three
stages in the complete evolution of the sense of duty. The
first, the lowest and that beyond which some persons never
go, is that in which "susceptibility to pleasure and pain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
is made use of to bring about obedience, and a mental association
is rapidly formed between the obedience and apprehended
pain, more or less magnified by fear." The fact
that punishment may be kept up until the child desists
from the act "leaves on his mind a certain dread and awful
impression as connected with forbidden actions." Here
we have in its germ conscience, acknowledgment of duty,
in its most external form.</p>

<p>A child in a good home (and a citizen in a good state)
soon adds other associations. The command is uttered,
the penalty threatened, by those whom he admires, respects,
and loves. This element brings in a new dread&mdash;the fear
of giving pain to the beloved object. Such dread is more
disinterested. It centers rather about the point of view
from which the act is held wrong than about the thought
of harm to self. As intelligence develops, the person apprehends
the positive ends, the goods, which are protected
by the command put on him; he sees the use and reason
of the prohibition to which he is subject, and approving
of what it safeguards, approves the restriction itself. "A
new motive is added on and begirds the action with a threefold
fear.... If the duty prescribed has been approved
of by the mind as <i>protective of the general interests of
persons engaging our sympathies</i>, the violation of this on
our part affects us with all the pain that we feel from
inflicting <i>an injury upon those interests</i>."</p>

<p><b>Transformation into an Internal Power.</b>&mdash;When the
child appreciates "<i>the reasons for the command, the character
of conscience is entirely transformed</i>." The fear
which began as fear of the penalty that a superior power
may inflict, adds to itself the fear of displeasing a beloved
person; and is finally transformed into the dread of injuring
interests the worth of which the individual appreciates
and in which he shares. The sense of duty now "stands
upon an independent foundation." It is an internal "ideal
resemblance of public authority," "an imitation (or fac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>simile)
within ourselves of the government without us."
"Regard is now had to the intent and meaning of the law
and not to the mere fact of its being prescribed by some
power." Thus there is developed a sense of obligation in
general, which may be detached from the particular deeds
which were originally imposed under the sanction of penalty,
and transferred to new ends which have never even
been socially imposed, which the individual has perhaps for
the first time conceived within himself. "The feeling and
habit of obligation" which was generated from social pressure
remains, but as a distinct individually cherished
thing (Bain, <i>Emotions and Will</i>, p. 319 n.). This view of
the <i>final</i> sense of obligation thus approximates Kant's view
of the autonomous character of duty.</p>

<p><b>(c) Spencer's Account.</b>&mdash;Herbert Spencer (like Bentham)
lays emphasis upon the restraining influence of various
social influences, but lays stress, as Bentham does
not, upon the <i>internal</i> changes effected by long-continued,
unremitting pressure exercised through the entire period
of human evolution. Taken in itself, the consciousness
of duty&mdash;the distinctively moral consciousness&mdash;is the control
of proximate ends by remote ones, of simple by complex
aims, of the sensory or presentative by the ideal or
representative. An undeveloped individual or race lives
and acts in the present; the mature is controlled by foresight
of an indefinitely distant future. The thief who
steals is actuated by a simple feeling, the mere impulse of
acquisition; the business man conducts his acquisition in
view of highly complex considerations of property and
ownership. A low-grade intelligence acts only upon
sensory stimulus, immediately present; a developed mind
is moved by elaborate intellectual constructions, by imaginations
and ideas which far outrun the observed or observable
scene. Each step of the development of intelligence,
of culture, whether in the individual or the race,
is dependent upon ability to <i>subordinate</i> the immediate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
simple, physically present tendency and aim to the remote,
compound, and only ideally present intention (Spencer,
<i>Principles of Ethics</i>, Vol. I., Part I, ch. vii.).</p>

<p><b>Subordination of Near to Remote Good Dependent
on Social Influences.</b>&mdash;"The conscious relinquishment of
immediate and special good to gain distant and general
good ... is a cardinal trait of the self-restraint called
moral." But this develops out of forms of restraint which
are not moral; where the "relinquishment" and subordination
of the present and temporary good is not consciously
willed by the individual in view of a conscious appreciation
of a distant and inclusive good; but where
action in view of the latter is forced upon the individual
by outside authority, operating by menace, and having
the sanction of fear. These outside controls are three in
number: political or legal; supernatural, priestly, or religious;
and popular. All these external controls, working
through dread of pain and promise of reward, bring
about, however, in the individual a habit of looking to the
remote, rather than to the proximate, end. At first the
thought of these extrinsic consequences, those which do
not flow from the act but from the reaction of others to
it, is mixed up with the thought of its own proper consequences.
But this association causes attention at least
to be fixed upon intrinsic consequences that, because of
their remoteness and complexity, might otherwise escape
attention. Gradually the thought of them grows in clearness
and efficacy and dissociates itself as a motive from
the externally imposed consequences, and there is a control
which alone is truly moral.</p>

<p><b>The Internal Sanction.</b>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The truly moral deterrent from murder, is not constituted
by a representation of hanging as a consequence, or by a representation
of tortures in hell as a consequence, or by a representation
of the horror and hatred excited in fellow-men; but
by a representation of the <i>necessary natural results</i>&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>infliction of death agony on the victim, the destruction of all
his possibilities of happiness, the entailed sufferings to his
belongings" (Spencer, <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 120).</p></div>

<p>The external constraints thus serve as a schoolmaster to
bring the race and the individual to internal restraint.
Gradually the abstract sense of coerciveness, authoritativeness,
the need of controlling the present by the future good
is disentangled, and there arises the sense of duty in general.
But even this "is transitory and will diminish as fast
as moralization increases" (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 127). Persistence in
performance of a duty makes it a pleasure; an habitually
exercised obligation is naturally agreeable.</p>

<p>In the present state of evolutionary development, obligation,
or the demands made by the external environment, and
spontaneous inclination, or the demand of the organism,
cannot coincide. But at the goal of evolution, the organism
and environment will be in perfect adjustment. Actions
congenial to the former and appropriate to the latter will
completely coincide. "In their proper times and places,
and proportions, the moral sentiments will guide men just
as spontaneously and adequately as now do the sensations"
(<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 129).</p>

<p><b>Criticism of Utilitarianism.</b>&mdash;The utilitarian account
of the development of the consciousness of duty or its
emphasis upon concrete facts of social arrangements and
education affords a much-needed supplement to the empty
and abstract formalism of Kant. (i.) The individual is
certainly brought to his actual recognition of specific duties
and to his consciousness of obligation or moral law in general
through social influences. Bain insists more upon the
family training and discipline of its immature members;
Bentham and Spencer more upon the general institutional
conditions, or the organization of government, law, judicial
procedure, crystallized custom, and public opinion. In
reality, these two conditions imply and re&euml;nforce each
other. It is through the school of the family, for the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
part, that the meaning of the requirements of the larger
and more permanent institutions are brought home to
the individual; while, on the other hand, the family derives
the aims and values which it enforces upon the attention
of its individual members mainly from the larger society
in which it finds its own setting. (ii.) The later utilitarianism,
in its insistence upon an "internal sanction," upon
the ideal personal, or free facsimile of public authority,
upon regard for "intrinsic consequences," corrects the
weak point in Bentham (who relies so unduly upon mere
threat of punishment and mere fear of pain) and approximates
in practical effect, though not in theory, Kant's
doctrine of the connection of duty with the rational or
"larger" self which is social, even if individual. Even in
its revised version utilitarianism did not wholly escape
from the rigid unreal separation between the selfhood
of the agent and his social surroundings forced upon it
by its hedonistic psychology.</p>

<p><b>Fictitious Theory of Nature of Self.</b>&mdash;The supposition
that the individual starts with mere love of private pleasure,
and that, if he ever gets beyond to consideration of the
good of others, it is because others have forced their good
upon him by interfering with his private pleasures, is pure
fiction. The requirements, encouragements, and approbations
of others react not primarily upon the pleasures and
calculations of the individual, but upon his <i>activities</i>, upon
his inclinations, desires, habits. There is a common defect
in the utilitarian and Kantian psychology. Both neglect
the importance of the active, the organically spontaneous
and direct tendencies which enter into the individual.
Both assume unreal "<i>states</i> of consciousness," passive
sensations, and feelings. Active tendencies may be internally
modified and redirected by the very conditions and
consequences of their own exercise. Family discipline,
jural influences, public opinion, may do little, or they may
do much. But their educative influence is as far from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
mere association of feelings of pleasure and pain as it is
from Kant's purely abstract law. <i>Social influences enable
an individual to realize the weight and import of the
socially available and helpful manifestations of the tendencies
of his own nature and to discriminate them from
those which are socially harmful or useless.</i> When the
two conflict, the perception of the former is the recognition
of duties as distinct from <i>mere</i> inclinations.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. FINAL STATEMENT</h4>

<p><b>Duty and a Growing Character.</b>&mdash;Duty is what is owed
by a partial isolated self embodied in established, facile, and
urgent tendencies, to that ideal self which is presented in
aspirations which, since they are not yet formed into
habits, have no organized hold upon the self and which
can get organized into habitual tendencies and interests
only by a more or less painful and difficult reconstruction
of the habitual self. For Kant's fixed and absolute separation
between the self of inclination and the self of reason,
we substitute the relative and shifting distinction between
those factors of self which have become so definitely organized
into set habits that they take care of themselves,
and those other factors which are more precarious, less
crystallized, and which depend therefore upon conscious
acknowledgment and intentionally directed affection. The
consciousness of duty grows out of the complex character
of the self; the fact that at any given time, it has tendencies
relatively set, ingrained, and embodied in fixed
habits, while it also has tendencies in process of making,
looking to the future, taking account of unachieved possibilities.
The former give the solid relatively formed
elements of character; the latter, its ideal or unrealized
possibilities. Each must play into the other; each must
help the other out.</p>

<p>The conflict of duty and desire is thus an accom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>paniment
of a <i>growing</i> self. Spencer's complete disappearance
of obligation would mean an exhausted and fossilized
self; wherever there is progress, tension arises between
what is already accomplished and what is possible. In a
being whose "reach should exceed his grasp," a conflict
within the self making for the readjustment of the direction
of powers must always be found. The value of continually
<i>having to meet the expectations and requirements
of others is in keeping the agent from resting on his oars,
from falling back on habits already formed as if they
were final</i>. The phenomena of duty in all their forms are
thus phenomena attendant upon the expansion of ends
and the reconstruction of character. So far, accordingly,
as the recognition of duty is capable of operating as a
distinct r&euml;enforcing motive, it operates most effectively,
not as an interest in duty, or law in the abstract, but as
an interest in progress in the face of the obstacles found
within character itself.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XVIII</small>

<br /><br />

THE PLACE OF THE SELF IN THE MORAL LIFE</h2>


<p>We have reached the conclusion that disposition as
manifest in endeavor is the seat of moral worth, and that
this worth itself consists in a readiness to regard the general
happiness even against contrary promptings of personal
comfort and gain. This brings us to the problems
connected with the nature and functions of the self. We
shall, in our search for the moral self, pass in review the
conceptions which find morality in (1) Self-Denial or Self-Sacrifice,
(2) Self-Assertion, (3) Combination of Regard
for Self and for Others, (4) Self-Realization.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. THE DOCTRINE OF SELF-DENIAL</h4>

<p><b>Widespread Currency of the Doctrine.</b>&mdash;The notion
that real goodness, or virtue, consists essentially in abnegation
of the self, in denying and, so far as may be, eliminating
everything that is of the nature of the self, is one
of the oldest and most frequently recurring notions of
moral endeavor and religion, as well as of moral theory. It
describes Buddhism and, in large measure, the monastic
ideal of Christianity, while, in Protestantism, Puritanism
is permeated with its spirit. It characterized Cynicism
and Stoicism. Kant goes as far as to say that every rational
being must wish to be wholly free from inclinations.
Popular morality, while not going so far as to hold that
all moral goodness is self-denial, yet more or less definitely
assumes that self-denial on its own account, irrespective of
what comes out of it, is morally praiseworthy. A notion
so deeply rooted and widely flourishing must have strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
motives in its favor, all the more so because its practical
vogue is always stronger than any reasons which are theoretically
set forth.</p>

<p><b>Origin of the Doctrine.</b>&mdash;The notion arises from the
tendency to identify the self with one of its own factors.
It is one and the same self which conceives and is interested
in some generous and ideal good that is also tempted by
some near, narrow, and exclusive good. The force of the
latter resides in the <i>habitual</i> self, in purposes which have
got themselves inwrought into the texture of ordinary
character. Hence there is a disposition to overlook the
complexity of selfhood, and to identify it with those factors
in the self which resist ideal aspiration, and which are
recalcitrant to the thought of duty; to identify the self
with impulses that are inclined to what is frivolous, sensuous
and sensual, pleasure-seeking. All vice being, then,
egoism, selfishness, self-seeking, the remedy is to check it
at its roots; to keep the self down in its proper place, denying
it, chastening it, mortifying it, refusing to listen to its
promptings. Ignoring the variety and subtlety of the
factors that make up the self, all the different elements of
right and of wrong are gathered together and set over
against each other. All the good is placed once for all in
some outside source, some higher law or ideal; and the
source of all evil is placed within the corrupted and vile
self. When one has become conscious of the serious nature
of the moral struggle; has found that vice is easy, and to
err "natural," needing only to give way to some habitual
impulse or desire; that virtue is arduous, requiring resistance
and strenuous effort, one is apt to overlook the
habitual tendencies which are the ministers of the higher
goods. One forgets that unless ideal ends were also
rooted in some natural tendencies of the self, they could
neither occur to the self nor appeal to the self. Hence
everything is swept into the idea that the self is inherently
so evil that it must be denied, snubbed, sacrificed, mortified.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>In general, to point out the truth which this theory perverts,
to emphasize the demand for constant reconstruction
and rearrangement of the habitual powers of the
self&mdash;is sufficient criticism of it. But in detail the theory
exercises such pervasive influence that it is worth
while to mention specifically some of the evils that accrue
from it.</p>

<p><b>1. It so Maims and Distorts Human Nature as to
Narrow the Conception of the Good.</b>&mdash;In its legitimate
antagonism to pleasure-seeking, it becomes a foe to happiness,
and an implacable enemy of all its elements. Art is
suspected, for beauty appeals to the lust of the eye. Family
life roots in sexual impulses, and property in love of
power, gratification, and luxury. Science springs from the
pride of the intellect; the State from the pride of will. <i>Asceticism</i>
is the logical result; a purely negative conception
of virtue. But it surely does dishonor, not honor, to the
moral life to conceive it as mere negative subjection of the
flesh, mere holding under control the lust of desire and
the temptations of appetite. All positive content, all liberal
achievement, is cut out and morality is reduced to a
mere struggle <i>against</i> solicitations to sin. While asceticism
is in no danger of becoming a popular doctrine, there
is a common tendency to conceive self-control in this negative
fashion; to fail to see that the important thing is some
positive good <i>for</i> which a desire is controlled. In general
we overemphasize that side of morality which consists
in abstinence and <i>not</i> doing wrong.</p>

<p><b>2. To Make so Much of Conflict with the "Flesh," is
to Honor the Latter too Much.</b>&mdash;It is to fix too much
attention on it. It is an open lesson of psychology that to
oppose doing an act by mere injunction not to do it, is to
increase the power of the thing <i>not</i> to be done, and to
weaken the spring and effectiveness of the other motives,
which, if positively attended to, might keep the obnoxious
motive from gaining supremacy. The "expulsive power"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
of a generous affection is more to be relied upon than effort
to suppress, which keeps alive the very thing to be suppressed.
The history of monks and Puritan saints alike
is full of testimony to the fact that withdrawal from
positive generous and wholesome aims re&euml;nforces the vitality
of the lower appetites and stimulates the imagination
to play about them. Flagellation and fasting work as
long as the body is exhausted; but the brave organism
reasserts itself, and its capacities for science, art, the life
of the family and the State not having been cultivated,
sheer ineradicable physical instinct is most likely to come
to the front.</p>

<p><b>3. We Judge Others by Ourselves Because We Have
No Other Way to Judge.</b>&mdash;It is impossible for a man
who conceives his own good to be in "going without," in
just restricting himself, to have any large or adequate
idea of the good of others. Unconsciously and inevitably
a hardening and narrowing of the conditions of the lives
of others accompanies the reign of the Puritanic ideal.
The man who takes a high view of the capacities of human
nature in itself, who reverences its possibilities and
is jealous for their high maintenance in himself, is the
one most likely to have keen and sensitive appreciation
of the needs of others. There is, moreover, no selfishness,
no neglect of others more thoroughgoing, more effectively
cruel than that which comes from preoccupation with the
attainment of personal goodness, and this interest is an
almost inevitable effect of devotion to the negative ideal
of self-denial.</p>

<p><b>4. The Principle Radically Violates Human Nature.</b>&mdash;This
indeed is its claim&mdash;that human nature, just as
human nature, requires to have violence done it. But the
capacities which constitute the self demand fulfillment.
The place, the time, the manner, the degree, and the proportion
of their fulfillment, require infinite care and pains,
and to secure this attention is the business of morals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
Morals is a matter of direction, not of suppression. The
urgency of desires and capacities for expression cannot be
got rid of; nature cannot be expelled. If the need of
happiness, of satisfaction of capacity, is checked in one
direction, it will manifest itself in another. If the direction
which is checked is an unconscious and wholesome one,
that which is taken will be likely to be morbid and perverse.
The one who is conscious of continually denying himself
cannot rid himself of the idea that it ought to be "made
up" to him; that a compensating happiness is due him
for what he has sacrificed, somewhat increased, if anything,
on account of the unnatural virtue he has displayed.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
To be self-sacrificing is to "lay up" merit, and
this achievement must surely be rewarded with happiness&mdash;if
not now, then later. Those who habitually live on the
basis of conscious self-denial are likely to be exorbitant
in the demands which they make on some one near them,
some member of their family or some friend; likely to blame
others if their own "virtue" does not secure for itself an
exacting attention which reduces others to the plane of
servility. Often the doctrine of self-sacrifice leads to an
inverted hedonism: we are to be good&mdash;that is, to forego
pleasure&mdash;now, that we may have a greater measure of
enjoyment in some future paradise of bliss. Or, the individual
who has taken vows of renunciation is entitled by
that very fact to represent spiritual authority on earth
and to lord it over others.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. SELF-ASSERTION</h4>

<p>The idea that morality consists in an unbridled assertion
of self, in its forceful aggressive manifestation, rarely
receives consistent theoretical formulation&mdash;possibly because
most men are so ready to act upon it practically
that explicit acknowledgment would be a hindrance rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
than a help to the idea. But it is a doctrine which tends
to be invoked more or less explicitly as a reaction from
the impotency of the self-denial dogma. In reference
to some superior individual or class, some leader or group
of aristocratically ordained leaders, it is always a more
or less conscious principle. Concerning these it is held that
ordinary morality holds eventually only for the "common
herd," the activities of the leader being amenable to
a higher law than that of common morality.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Moreover,
since the self-sacrifice morality is almost never carried out
consistently&mdash;that is, to the point of monastic asceticism,&mdash;much
popular morality is an unbalanced combination of
self-sacrifice in some regards and ruthless self-assertion in
others. It is not "practicable" to carry out the principle
of self-denial everywhere; it is reserved for the family
life, for special religious duties; in business (which is business,
not morals), the proper thing is aggressive and unremitting
self-assertion. In business, the end is success, to
"make good"; weakness is failure, and failure is disgrace,
dishonor. Thus in practice the two conceptions of self-denial
in one region and self-assertion in another mutually
support each other. They give occasion for the more or
less unformulated, yet prevalent, idea that moral considerations
(those of self-denial) apply to a limited phase
of life, but have nothing to do with other regions in which
accordingly the principle of "efficiency" (that is, personal
success, wealth, power obtained in competitive victory)
holds supreme sway.</p>

<p>Recently, however, there has sprung up a so-called
"naturalistic" school of ethics which has formulated explicitly
the principle of self-assertion, and which claims to
find scientific sanction for it in the evolutionary doctrine
of Darwin. Evolution, it says, is the great thing, and
evolution means the <i>survival of the fit in the struggle for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
existence</i>. Nature's method of progress is precisely, so it
is said, ruthless self-assertion&mdash;to the strong the victory,
to the victorious the spoils, and to the defeated, woe. Nature
affords a scene of egoistic endeavor or pressure, suffer
who may, of struggle to get ahead, that is, ahead of others,
even by thrusting them down and out. But the justification
of this scene of rapine and slaughter is that out of
it comes progress, advance, everything that we regard
as noble and fair. Excellence is the sign of excelling;
the goal means outrunning others. The morals of humility,
of obedience to law, of pity, sympathy, are merely
a self-protective device on the part of the weak who try
to safeguard their weakness by setting fast limitations to
the activities of the truly strong (compare what was said of
the not dissimilar doctrine among the Greeks, pp. 120-22).
But the truly moral man, in whom the principle of progress
is embodied, will break regardlessly through these
meshes and traps. He will carry his own plans through
to victorious achievement. He is the super-man. The
mass of men are simply food for his schemes, valuable as
furnishing needed material and tools.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p><b>Practical Vogue of the Underlying Idea.</b>&mdash;Such a
theory, in and of itself, is a literary diversion for those
who, not being competent in the fields of outer achievement,
amuse themselves by idealizing it in writing. Like most
literary versions of science, it rests upon a pseudo-science,
a parody of the real facts. But at a time when economic
conditions are putting an extraordinary emphasis upon
outward achievement, upon success in manipulating nat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>ural
and social resources, upon "efficiency" in exploiting
both inanimate energies and the minds and bodies of other
persons, the underlying principle of this theory has a
sanction and vogue which is out of all proportion to the
number of those who consciously entertain it as a theory.
For a healthy mind, the frank statement and facing of the
theory is its best criticism. Its bald brutalism flourishes
freely only when covered and disguised. But in view of the
forces at present, and especially in America, making for
a more or less unconscious acceptance of its principle in
practice, it may be advisable to say something (1) regarding
its alleged scientific foundation, and (2) the
inadequacy of its conception of efficiency.</p>

<p><b>1. The Theory Exaggerates the R&ocirc;le of Antagonistic
Competitive Struggle in the Darwinian Theory.</b>&mdash;(a)
The initial step in any "progress" is <i>variation</i>; this is
not so much struggle <i>against</i> other organisms, as it is
<i>invention</i> or discovery of some <i>new</i> way of acting, involving
better adaptation of hitherto merely latent natural
resources, use of some possible food or shelter not previously
utilized. The struggle against other organisms
at work preserves from elimination a species already
fixed&mdash;quite a different thing from the variation which
occasions the introduction of a higher or more complex
species. (b) Moreover, so far as the Darwinian theory
is concerned, the "struggle for existence" may take any
conceivable form; rivalry in generosity, in mutual aid
and support, may be the kind of competition best fitted
to enable a species to survive. It not only may be so, but
it is so within certain limits. The rage for survival, for
power, must not be asserted indiscriminately; the mate of
the other sex, the young, to some extent other individuals
of the same kin, are spared, or, in many cases, protected
and nourished.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>  (c) The higher the form of life, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
<i>more</i> effective the two methods just suggested: namely,
the method of intelligence in discovering and utilizing new
methods, tools, and resources as substituted for the direct
method of brute conflict; and the method of mutual protection
and care substituted for mutual attack and combat.
It is among the lower forms of life, not as the theory
would require among the higher types, that conditions
approximate its picture of the gladiatorial show. The
higher species among the vertebrates, as among insects
(like ants and bees), are the "sociable" kinds. It is sometimes
argued that Darwinism carried into morals would
abolish charity: all care of the hopelessly invalid, of the
economically dependent, and in general of all the weak and
helpless except healthy infants. It is argued that our current
standards are sentimental and artificial, aiming to
make survive those who are unfit, and thus tending to
destroy the conditions that make for advance, and to introduce
such as make towards degeneration. But this
argument (1) wholly ignores the reflex effect of interest
in those who are ill and defective in strengthening social
solidarity&mdash;in promoting those ties and reciprocal interests
which are as much the prerequisites of strong individual
characters as they are of a strong social group.
And (2) it fails to take into account the stimulus to foresight,
to scientific discovery, and practical invention, which
has proceeded from interest in the helpless, the weak, the
sick, the disabled, blind, deaf, and insane. Taking the
most coldly scientific view, the gains in these two respects
have, through the growth of social pity, of care for the
unfortunate, been purchased more cheaply than we can
imagine their being bought in any other way. In other
words, the chief objection to this "naturalistic" ethics is
that it overlooks the fact that, even from the Darwinian
point of view, the human <i>animal</i> is a <i>human</i> animal. It
forgets that the sympathetic and social instincts, those
which cause the individual to take the interests of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
others for his own and thereby to restrain his sheer
brute self-assertiveness, are the highest achievements, the
high-water mark of evolution. The theory urges a systematic
relapse to lower and foregone stages of biological
development.</p>

<p><b>2. Its Conception of "Power," "Efficiency," "Achievement"
is Perverse.</b>&mdash;Compared with the gospel of abstinence,
of inefficiency, preached by the self-denial school,
there is an element of healthy reaction in any ethical system
which stresses positive power, positive success, positive
attainment. Goodness has been too much identified
with practical feebleness and ineptitude; strength and
solidity of accomplishment, with unscrupulousness. But
power for the sake of power is as unreal an abstraction
as self-denial for the sake of sacrifice, or self-restraint
for the sake of the mere restraint. Erected into a central
principle, it takes means for end&mdash;the fallacy of all materialism.
It makes little of many of the most important
and excellent <i>inherent ingredients</i> of happiness in its
eagerness to master <i>external conditions</i> of happiness.
Sensitive discrimination of complex and refined distinctions
of worth, such as good taste, the resources of poetry and
history, frank and varied social converse among intellectual
equals, the humor of sympathetic contemplation of
the spectacle of life, the capacity to extract happiness
from solitude and society, from nature and from art:&mdash;all
of these, as well as the more obvious virtues of sympathy
and benevolence, are swept aside for one coarse undiscriminating
ideal of external activity, measured by sheer quantity
of external changes made and external results accumulated.
Of such an ideal we may say, as Mill said,
that the judge of good, of happiness, is the one who has
experienced its various forms; and that as "no intelligent
person would consent to be a fool" on account of the pleasures
of the fool, so no man of cultivated spirit would
consent to be a lover of "efficiency" and "power" for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
sake of brute command of the external commodities of
nature and man.</p>

<p><b>Present Currency of This Ideal.</b>&mdash;In spite of the extraordinary
currency of this ideal at present, there is
little fear that it will be permanently established. Human
nature is too rich and varied in its capacities and demands;
the world of nature and society is too fruitful in sources
of stimulus and interest for man to remain indefinitely
content with the idea of power for power's sake, command
of means for the mere sake of the means. Humanity has
long lived a precarious and a stunted life because of its
partial and easily shaken hold on natural resources.
Starved by centuries of abstinence enforced through lack
of control of the forces and methods of nature, taught
the gospel of the merit of abstention, it is not surprising
that it should be intoxicated when scientific discovery
bears its fruit of power in utilization of natural
forces, or that, temporarily unbalanced, it should take the
external conditions of happiness for happiness itself. But
when the values of material acquisition and achievement
become familiar they will lose the contrast value they now
possess; and human endeavor will concern itself mainly
with the problem of rendering its conquests in power and
efficiency tributary to the life of intelligence and art and
of social communication.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Such a moral idealism will rest
upon a more secure and extensive natural foundation than
that of the past, and will be more equitable in applica<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>tion
and saner in content than that with which aristocracies
have made us familiar. It will be a democratic ideal,
a good for all, not for a noble class; and it will include,
not exclude, those physical and physiological factors which
aristocratic idealisms have excluded as common and
unclean.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. SELF-LOVE AND BENEVOLENCE; OR, EGOISM AND
ALTRUISM</h4>

<p>For the last three centuries, the most discussed point
in English ethical literature (save perhaps whether moral
knowledge is intuitive or derived from experience) has
been the relation of regard for one's own self and for
other selves as motives of action&mdash;"the crux of all ethical
speculation," Spencer terms it. All views have been represented:
(a) that man naturally acts from purely selfish
motives and that morality consists in an enforced subjection
of self-love to the laws of a common social order,
(b) That man is naturally selfish, while morality is an
"enlightened selfishness," or a regard for self based upon
recognition of the extent to which its happiness requires
consideration of others. (c) That the tendencies of the
agent are naturally selfish, but that morality is the subjection
of these tendencies to the law of duty. (d) That
man's interests are naturally partly egoistic and partly
sympathetic, while morality is a compromise or adjustment
of these tendencies. (e) That man's interests are naturally
both, and morality a subjection of both to conscience as
umpire. (f) That they are both, while morality is a subjection
of egoistic to benevolent sentiments. (g) That the
individual's interests are naturally in objective ends which
primarily are neither egoistic nor altruistic; and these
ends become either selfish or benevolent at special crises,
at which times morality consists in referring them, equally
and impartially for judgment, to a situation in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
the interests of the self and of others concerned are involved:
<i>to a common good</i>.</p>

<p><b>Three Underlying Psychological Principles.</b>&mdash;We shall
make no attempt to discuss these various views in detail;
but will bring into relief some of the factors in the discussion
which substantiate the view (g) stated last. It will be
noted that the theories rank themselves under three heads
with reference to the constitution of man's tendencies:
holding they (1) naturally have in view personal ends exclusively
or all fall under the principle of self-love or self-regard;
that (2) some of them contemplate one's own happiness
and some of them that of others; that (3) primarily
they are not <i>consciously</i> concerned with either one's own
happiness or that of others. Memory and reflection may
show (just as it shows other things) that their consequences
affect both the self and others, when the recognition
of this fact becomes an additional element, either for
good or for evil, in the motivation of the act. We shall
consider, first, the various senses in which action occurs,
or is said to occur, in behalf of the person's own self;
and then take up, in similar fashion, its reference to the
interests of others.</p>

<p><b>I. Action in Behalf of Self.</b>&mdash;1. <i>Motives as Selfish</i>:
The Natural Selfishness of Man is maintained from such
different standpoints and with such different objects in
view that it is difficult to state the doctrine in any one
generalized form. By some theologians, it has been associated
with an innate corruption or depravity of human
nature and been made the basis of a demand for supernatural
assistance to lead a truly just and benevolent life.
By Hobbes (1588-1679) it was associated with the anti-social
nature of individuals and made the basis for a plea
for a strong and centralized political authority<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> to con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>trol
the natural "war of all against all" which flows inevitably
from the psychological egoism. By Kant, it was
connected with the purely sense origin of desires, and
made the basis for a demand for the complete subordination
of desire to duty as a motive for action. Morals, like
politics, make strange bedfellows! The common factor in
these diverse notions, however, is that every act of a self
must, when left to its <i>natural</i> or psychological course,
have the interest of the self in view; otherwise there would
be no motive for the deed and it would not be done. This
theoretical and <i>a priori</i> view is further supported by pointing
out, sometimes in reprobation of man's sinful nature,
sometimes in a more or less cynical vein, the lurking presence
of some subtle regard for self in acts that apparently
are most generous and "disinterested."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p><b>Ambiguity of the Psychological Basis.</b>&mdash;The notion
that all action is "for the self" is infected with the same
ambiguity as the (analogous) doctrine that all desire
is for happiness. Like that doctrine, in one sense it is
a truism, in another a falsity&mdash;this latter being the sense
in which its upholders maintain it. Psychologically, any
object that moves us, any object in which we imagine our
impulses to rest satisfied or to find fulfillment, <i>becomes</i>, in
virtue of that fact, a factor in the self. If I am enough
interested in collecting postage stamps, a collection of
postage stamps becomes a part of my "ego," which is incomplete
and restless till filled out in that way. If my
habits are such that I am not content when I know my
neighbor is suffering from a lack of food until I have
relieved him, then relief of his suffering becomes a part
of my selfhood. If my desires are such that I have no
rest of mind until I have beaten my competitor in business,
or have demonstrated my superiority in social gifts
by putting my fellow at some embarrassing disadvantage,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
then that sort of thing constitutes my self. Our instincts,
impulses, and habits all demand appropriate objects in
order to secure exercise and expression; and these ends
in their office of furnishing outlet and satisfaction to our
powers form a cherished part of the "me." In this sense
it is true, and a truism, that all action involves the interest
of self.</p>

<p><b>True and False Interpretation.</b>&mdash;But this doctrine is
the exact opposite of that intended by those who claim
that all action is from self-love. The true doctrine says,
<i>the self is constituted and developed through instincts and
interests which are directed upon their own objects with
no conscious regard necessarily for anything except those
objects themselves</i>. The false doctrine implies that the
self <i>exists by itself apart from these objective ends, and
that they are merely means for securing it a certain profit
or pleasure</i>.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, it is a case of being so disturbed
in mind by the thought of another in pain that one is
moved to do something to relieve him. This means that
certain native instincts or certain acquired habits demand
relief of others as part of themselves. The well-being of
the other is an interest of the self: is a part of the self.
This is precisely what is meant ordinarily by unselfishness:
not lack or absence of a self, but <i>such</i> a self as
identifies itself in action with others' interests and hence
is satisfied only when they are satisfied. To find pain in
the thought of others pained and to take pleasure in the
thought of their relief, is to have and to be moved by
personal motives, by states which are "selfish" in the sense
of making up the self; but which are the exact opposite
of selfish in the sense of being the thought of some private
advantage to self.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Putting it roundly, then, the fallacy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
of the selfish motive theory is that it fails to see that
<i>instincts and habits directed upon objects are primary</i>,
and that they come before any conscious thought of self
as end, since they are necessary to the constitution of
that thought.</p>

<p>The following quotation from James<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> states the true
doctrine:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When I am led by selflove to keep my seat whilst ladies
stand, or to grab something first and cut out my neighbor,
what I really love is the comfortable seat; it is the thing
itself which I grab. I love <i>them</i> primarily, as the mother
loves her babe, or a generous man an heroic deed. Wherever,
as here, selfseeking is the outcome of simple instinctive propensity,
it is but a name for certain reflex acts. Something
rivets my attention fatally and fatally provokes the 'selfish'
response.... It is true I am no automaton, but a thinker.
But my thoughts, like my acts, are here concerned only with
the outward things.... In fact the more utterly selfish I
am in this primitive way, the more blindly absorbed my
thought will be in the objects and impulses of my lust and
the more devoid of any inward looking glance."</p></div>

<p><b>2. Results as Selfish: Ambiguity in the Notion.</b>&mdash;We
must then give up the notion that motives are inherently
self-seeking, in the sense that there is in voluntary
acts a thought of the self as the end for the sake of which
the act is performed. The self-seeking doctrine may,
however, be restated in these terms: Although there is
no thought of self or its advantage consciously entertained,
yet our original instincts are such that their
objects do as <i>matter of result</i> conduce primarily to the
well-being and advantage of the self. In this sense, anger,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
fear, hunger, and thirst, etc., are said to be egoistic or self-seeking&mdash;not
that their <i>conscious</i> object is the self, but
that their inevitable effect is to preserve and protect the
self. The fact that an instinct secures self-preservation
or self-development does not, however, make it "egoistic" or
"selfish" in the moral sense; nor does it throw any light
upon the moral status of the instinct. <i>Everything depends
upon the sort of self which is maintained.</i> There is,
indeed, some presumption (see <i>ante</i>, p. 294) that the act
sustains a <i>social</i> self, that is, a self whose maintenance is of
social value. If the individual organism did not struggle
for food; strive aggressively against obstacles and interferences;
evade or shelter itself against menacing superior
force, what would become of children, fathers and
mothers, lawyers, doctors and clergymen, citizens and
patriots&mdash;in short, of society? If we avoid setting up a
purely abstract self, if we keep in mind that every actual
self is a self which <i>includes</i> social relations and offices,
both actual and potential, we shall have no difficulty
in seeing that self-preservative instincts <i>may</i> be, and taken
by and large, <i>must</i> be, socially conservative. Moreover,
while it is not true that if "a man does not look after his
own interests no one else will" (if that means that his interests
are no one else's affair in any way), it is true
that no one has a right to neglect his own interests in
the hope that some one else will care for them. "His own
interests," properly speaking, are precisely the ends which
concern him more directly than they concern any one else.
Each man is, so to say, nearer himself than is any one
else, and, therefore, has certain duties to and about himself
which cannot be performed by any other one. Others
may present food or the conditions of education, but the
individual alone can digest the food or educate himself.
It is profitable for society, not merely for an individual,
that each of us should instinctively have his powers most
actively and intensely called out by the things that dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>tinctively
affect him and his own welfare. Any other
arrangement would mean waste of social energy, inefficiency
in securing social results.</p>

<p>The quotation from James also makes it clear, however,
that under certain circumstances the mere absorption in
a thing, even without conscious thought of self, is morally
offensive. The "pig" in manners is not necessarily thinking
of himself; all that is required to make him a pig
is that he should have too narrow and exclusive an object
of regard. The man sees simply the seat, not the seat
<i>and</i> the lady. The boor in manners is unconscious of
many of the objects in the situation which <i>should</i> operate
as stimuli. One impulse or habit is operating at the
expense of others; the self in play is too petty or narrow.
Viewed from the standpoint of results, the fact which constitutes
selfishness in the moral sense is not that certain
impulses and habits secure the well-being of the self, <i>but
that the well-being secured is a narrow and exclusive one</i>.
The forms of coarse egoism which offend us most in ordinary
life are not usually due to a deliberate or self-conscious
seeking of advantage for self, but to such preoccupation
with certain ends as blinds the agent to the
thought of the interests of others. Many whose behavior
seems to others most selfish would deny indignantly (and,
from the standpoint of their <i>definite</i> consciousness, honestly)
any self-seeking motives: they would point to certain
objective results, which in the abstract are desirable, as
the true ends of their activities. But none the less, they
<i>are</i> selfish, because the limitations of their interests make
them overlook the consequences which affect the freedom
and happiness of others.</p>

<p><b>3. There are also Cases in Which the Thought of
the Resulting Consequence to the Self Consciously
Enters in and Modifies the Motive of the Act.</b>&mdash;With
increasing memory and foresight, one can no more ignore
the lesson of the past as to the consequences of an act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
upon himself than he can ignore other consequences. A
man who has learned that a certain act has painful consequences
to himself, whether to his body, his reputation,
his comfort, or his character, is quite likely to have the
thought of himself present itself as part of the foreseen
consequences when the question of a similar act recurs.
In and of itself, once more, this fact throws no light upon
the moral status of the act. Everything depends upon
what sort of a self moves and how it moves. A man who
hesitated to rush into a burning building to rescue a suit
of clothes because he thought of the danger to himself,
would be sensible; a man who rushed out of the
building just because he thought of saving himself when
there were others he might have assisted, would be contemptible.</p>

<p>The one who began taking exercise because he thought
of his own health, would be commended; but a man who
thought so continually of his own health as to shut out
other objects, would become an object of ridicule or worse.
<i>There is a moral presumption that a man should make
consideration of himself a part of his aim and intent.</i> A
certain care of health, of body, of property, of mental
faculty, because they are one's own is not only permissible,
but obligatory. This is what the older moral writers
spoke of as "prudence," or as "reasonable self-love."</p>

<p>(i.) It is a stock argument of the universal selfishness
theory to point out that a man's acknowledgment of some
<i>public need or benefit</i> is quite likely to coincide with his
recognition of some private advantage. A statesman's
recognition of some measure of public policy happens to
coincide with perceiving that by pressing it he can bring
himself into prominence or gain office. A man is more
likely to see the need of improved conditions of sanitation
or transportation in a given locality if he has property
there. A man's indignation at some prevalent public ill
may sleep till he has had a private taste of it. We may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
admit that these instances describe a usual, though not
universal, state of affairs. But does it follow that such
men are moved <i>merely</i> by the thought of gain to themselves?
Possibly this sometimes happens; then the act is
selfish in the obnoxious sense. The man has isolated his
thought of himself as an end and made the thought of
the improvement or reform merely an external means.
The latter is not truly his <i>end</i> at all; he has not identified
it with himself. In other cases, while the individual would
not have recognized the end if the thought of himself had
not been implicated, yet <i>after</i> he has recognized it, the
two&mdash;the thought of himself and of the public advantage&mdash;may
blend. His thought of himself may lend warmth and
intimacy to an object which otherwise would have been
cold, <i>while, at the same time, the self is broadened and
deepened by taking in the new object of regard</i>.</p>

<p>(ii.) Take the case of amusement or recreation. To an
adult usually engaged in strenuous pursuits, the thought
of a pleasure for the mere sake of pleasure, of enjoyment,
of having a "good time," may appeal as an end. And if
the pleasure is itself "innocent," only the requirements of
a preconceived theory (like the Kantian) would question
its legitimacy. Even its moral necessity is clear when
relaxation is conducive to cheerfulness and efficiency
in more serious pursuits. But if a man discriminates
mentally between himself and the play or exercise in
which he finds enjoyment and relief, thinking of himself
as a distinct end to which the latter is merely means,
he is not likely to get the recreation. It is by forgetting
the self, that is by taking the light and easy activity <i>as</i>
the self of the situation, that the benefit comes. To be
a "lover of pleasure" in the bad sense is precisely to
seek amusements as excitements for a self which somehow
remains outside them as their fixed and ulterior
end.</p>

<p>(iii.) Exactly the same analysis applies to the idea of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
the moral culture of the self, of its moral perfecting.
Every serious-minded person has, from time to time, to
take stock of his status and progress in moral matters&mdash;to
take thought of the moral self just as at other times
he takes thought of the health of the bodily self. But
woe betides that man who, having entered upon a course of
reflection which leads to a clearer conception of his own
moral capacities and weaknesses, maintains that thought
as a distinct mental end, and thereby makes his subsequent
acts simply means to improving or perfecting his moral
nature. Such a course defeats itself. At the least, it
leads to priggishness, and its tendency is towards one of
the worst forms of selfishness: a habit of thinking and feeling
that persons, that concrete situations and relations,
exist simply to render contributions to one's own precious
moral character. The worst of such selfishness is that
having protected itself with the mantle of interest in moral
goodness, it is proof against that attrition of experience
which may always recall a man to himself in the case of
grosser and more unconscious absorption. A sentimentally
refined egoism is always more hopeless than a brutal and
na&iuml;ve one&mdash;though a brutal one not infrequently protects
itself by adoption and proclamation of the language of
the former.</p>

<p><b>II. Benevolence or Regard for Others.</b>&mdash;<i>Ambiguity in
Conception</i>: There is the same ambiguity in the idea of
sympathetic or altruistic springs to action that there is
in that of egoistic and self-regarding. Does the phrase
refer to their conscious and express intent? or to their
objective results when put into operation, irrespective
of explicit desire and aim? And, if the latter, are we
to believe contribution to the welfare of others to be
the sole and exclusive character of some springs of
action, or simply that, under certain circumstances, the
<i>emphasis</i> falls more upon the good resulting to others
than upon other consequences? The discussion will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
show that the same general principles hold for "benevolent"
as for self-regarding impulses: namely (1) that
there are none which from the start are consciously such;
(2) that while reflection may bring to light their bearing
upon the welfare of others so that it becomes an element
in the conscious desire, this is a matter of relative preponderance,
not of absolute nature; and (3) that just as
conscious regard for self is not necessarily bad or "selfish,"
so conscious regard for others is not necessarily good:
the criterion is the whole situation in which the desire
takes effect.</p>

<p><b>1. The Existence of Other-Regarding Springs to
Action.</b>&mdash;Only the preconceptions of hedonistic psychology
would ever lead one to deny the existence of reactions
and impulses called out by the sight of others' misery
and joy and which tend to increase the latter and to relieve
the former. Recent psychologists (writing, of course,
quite independently of ethical controversies) offer lists
of native instinctive tendencies such as the following:
Anger, jealousy, rivalry, secretiveness, acquisitiveness,
fear, shyness, sympathy, affection, pity, sexual love, curiosity,
imitation, play, constructiveness.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> In this inventory,
the first seven may be said to be aroused specially
by situations having to do with the preservation of the
self; the next four are responses to stimuli proceeding
especially from others and tending to consequences favorable
to them, while the last four are mainly impersonal.
But the division into self-regarding and other-regarding
is not exclusive and absolute. Anger <i>may</i> be wholly other-regarding,
as in the case of hearty indignation at wrongs
suffered by others; rivalry may be generous emulation or
be directed toward surpassing one's own past record.
Love between the sexes, which should be the source of
steady, far-reaching interest in others, and which at times
expresses itself in supreme abnegation of devotion, easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
becomes the cause of brutal and persistent egoism. In
short, the division into egoistic and altruistic holds only
"other things being equal."</p>

<p>Confining ourselves for the moment to the native psychological
equipment, we may say that man is endowed
with instinctive promptings which naturally (that is, without
the intervention of deliberation or calculation) tend to
preserve the self (by aggressive attack as in anger, or in
protective retreat as in fear); and to develop his powers
(as in acquisitiveness, constructiveness, and play); and
which equally, without consideration of resulting ulterior
benefit either to self or to others, tend to bind the
self closer to others and to advance the interests of others&mdash;as
pity, affectionateness, or again, constructiveness and
play. Any given individual is <i>naturally</i> an erratic mixture
of fierce insistence upon his own welfare and of profound
susceptibility to the happiness of others&mdash;different individuals
varying much in the respective intensities and proportions
of the two tendencies.</p>

<p><b>2. The Moral Status of Altruistic Tendencies.</b>&mdash;We
have expressly devoted considerable space (ch. xiii.) to
showing that there are no motives which in and of themselves
are right; that any tendency, whether original
instinct or acquired habit, requires sanction from the
special consequences which, in the special situation, are
likely to flow from it. The mere fact that pity in general
tends to conserve the welfare of others does not guarantee
the rightness of giving way to an impulse of pity,
just as it happens to spring up. This might mean sentimentalism
for the agent, and weakening of the springs of
patience, courage, self-help, and self-respect in others.
The persistence with which the doctrine of the evils of
indiscriminate charity has to be taught is sufficient evidence
that the so-called other-regarding impulses require
the same control by reason as do the "egoistic" ones.
They have no inherent sacredness which exempts them from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
the application of the standard of the common and reasonable
happiness.</p>

<p><b>Evils of Unregulated Altruism.</b>&mdash;So much follows from
the general principles already discussed. But there are
special dangers and evils attendant upon an exaggeration
of the altruistic idea. (i.) <i>It tends to render others dependent</i>,
and thus contradicts its own professed aim: the
helping of others. Almost every one knows some child who
is so continuously "helped" by others, that he loses his
initiative and resourcefulness. Many an invalid is confirmed
in a state of helplessness by the devoted attention
of others. In large social matters there is always danger
of the substitution of an ideal of conscious "benevolence"
for justice: it is in aristocratic and feudal periods that
the idea flourishes that "charity" (conceived as conferring
benefits <i>upon</i> others, doing things <i>for</i> them) is inherently
and absolutely a good. The idea assumes the continued
and necessary existence of a dependent "lower" class to
be the recipients of the kindness of their superiors; a class
which serves as passive material for the cultivation in
others of the virtue of charity, the higher class "acquiring
merit" at expense of the lower, while the lower
has gratitude and respect for authority as its chief virtues.</p>

<p>(ii.) <i>The erection of the "benevolent" impulse into a
virtue in and of itself tends to build up egoism in others.</i>
The child who finds himself unremittingly the object of
attention from others is likely to develop an exaggerated
sense of the relative importance of his own <i>ego</i>. The
chronic invalid, conspicuously the recipient of the conscious
altruism of others, is happy in nature who avoids the slow
growth of an insidious egoism. Men who are the constant
subjects of abnegation on the part of their wives
and female relatives rarely fail to develop a self-absorbed
complacency and unconscious conceit.</p>

<p>(iii.) Undue emphasis upon altruism as a motive is quite
likely to react to form a <i>peculiarly subtle egoism in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
person who cultivates it</i>. Others cease to be <i>natural</i> objects
of interest and regard, and are converted into excuses for
the manifestation and nurture of one's own generous goodness.
Underlying complacency with respect to social ills
grows up because they afford an opportunity for developing
and displaying this finest of virtues. In our interest
in the maintenance of our own benign altruism we cease
to be properly disturbed by conditions which are intrinsically
unjust and hateful.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> (iv.) As present circumstances
amply demonstrate, there is the danger that
the erection of benevolence into a conscious principle in
some things will serve to supply rich persons with a cloak
for selfishness in other directions. Philanthropy is made
an offset and compensation for brutal exploitation. A
man who pushes to the breaking-point of legality aggressively
selfish efforts to get ahead of others in business,
squares it in his own self-respect and in the esteem of
those classes of the community who entertain like conceptions,
by gifts of hospitals, colleges, missions, and
libraries.</p>

<p><b>Genuine and False Altruism.</b>&mdash;These considerations
may be met by the obvious retort that it is not true
altruism, genuine benevolence, sincere charity, which we
are concerned with in such cases. This is a true remark.
We are not of course criticizing true but spurious interest
in others. But why is it counterfeit? What is the nature
of the genuine article? The danger is not in benevolence
or altruism, but in that conception of them which makes
them equivalent to regard for others <i>as others</i>, irrespective
of a social situation to which all alike belong. There is
nothing in the selfhood of others, because they are others,
which gives it any supremacy over selfhood in oneself.
Just as it is exclusiveness of objective ends, the ignoring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
of relations, which is objectionable in selfishness, so it is
taking the part for the whole which is obnoxious in so-called
altruism. To include in our view of consequences the
needs and possibilities of others on the same basis as our
own, is to take the only course which will give an adequate
view of the situation. There is no situation into which
these factors do not enter. To have a generous view of
others is to have a larger world in which to act. To
remember that they, like ourselves, are persons, are individuals
who are centers of joy and suffering, of lack and
of potentiality, is alone to have a just view of the conditions
and issues of behavior. Quickened sympathy means
liberality of intelligence and enlightened understanding.</p>

<p><b>The Social Sense versus Altruism.</b>&mdash;There is a great
difference in principle between modern philanthropy and
the "charity" which assumes a superior and an inferior
class. The latter principle tries to acquire merit by employing
one's superior resources to lessen, or to mitigate, the
misery of those who are fixed in a dependent status. Its
principle, so far as others are concerned, is negative and
palliative merely. The motive of what is vital in modern
philanthropy is constructive and expansive because it
looks to the well-being of society as a whole, not to
soothing or rendering more tolerable the conditions of a
class. It realizes the interdependence of interests: that
complex and variegated interaction of conditions which
makes it impossible for any one individual or "class" really
to secure, to assure, its own good as a separate thing. Its
aim is general social advance, constructive social reform,
not merely doing something kind for individuals who are
rendered helpless from sickness or poverty. Its aim is
the equity of justice, not the inequality of conferring
benefits. That the sight of the misery that comes from
sickness, from insanity, from defective organic structure
(as among the blind and deaf), from poverty that destroys
hope and dulls initiative, from bad nutrition, should stim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>ulate
this general quickening of the social sense is natural.
But just as the activities of the parent with reference
to the welfare of a helpless infant are wisely directed in
the degree in which attention is mainly fixed not upon
weakness, but upon positive opportunities for growth, so
the efforts of those whose activities, by the nature of circumstances,
have to be especially remedial and palliative
are most effective when centered on the social rights and
possibilities of the unfortunate individuals, instead of
treating them as separate individuals to whom, in their
separateness, "good is to be done."</p>

<p>The best kind of help to others, whenever possible, is
indirect, and consists in such modifications of the conditions
of life, of the general level of subsistence, as enables
them independently to help themselves.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Whenever conditions
require purely direct and personal aid, it is best
given when it proceeds from a natural social relationship,
and not from a motive of "benevolence" as a separate
force.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The gift that pauperizes when proceeding from
a philanthropist in his special capacity, is a beneficent
acknowledgment of the relationships of the case when it
comes from a neighbor or from one who has other interests
in common with the one assisted.</p>

<p><b>The Private and the Social Self.</b>&mdash;The contrast between
the narrow or restrictive and the general or
expansive good explains why evil presents itself as a
selfish end in contrast with an authoritative, but faint,
good of others. This is not, as we have seen, because
regard for the good of self is inherently bad and regard
for that of others intrinsically right; but because we are
apt to identify the self with the habitual, with that to
which we are best adjusted and which represents the cus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>tomary
occupation. Any moral crisis is thus fairly pictured
as a struggle to overcome selfishness. The tendency
under such circumstances is to contract, to secrete, to hang
on to what is already achieved and possessed. The habitual
self needs to go out of the narrowness of its accustomed
grooves into the spacious air of more generous
behavior.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4. THE GOOD AS SELF-REALIZATION</h4>

<p>We now come to the theory which attempts to do justice
to the one-sided truths we have been engaged with, <i>viz.</i>,
the idea that the moral end is <i>self-realization</i>. Like self-assertion
in some respects, it differs in conceiving the self
to be realized as universal and ultimate, involving the fulfillment
of <i>all</i> capacities and the observance of <i>all</i>
relations. Such a comprehensive self-realization includes
also, it is urged, the truth of altruism, since the "universal
self" is realized only when the relations that bind
one to others are fulfilled. It avoids also the inconsistencies
and defects of the notion of self-sacrifice for its own sake,
while emphasizing that the present incomplete self must be
denied for the sake of attainment of a more complete and
final self. A discussion of this theory accordingly furnishes
the means of gathering together and summarizing
various points regarding the r&ocirc;le of the self in the moral
life.</p>

<p><b>Ambiguity in the Conception.</b>&mdash;Is self-realization the
end? As we have had such frequent occasion to observe,
"end" means either the consequences actually effected, the
closing and completing phase of an act, or the aim held
deliberately in view. Now realization of self is an end
(though not the only end) in the former sense. Every
moral act in its outcome marks a development or fulfillment
of selfhood. But the very nature of right action
forbids that the self should be the end in the sense of
being the conscious aim of moral activity. For there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
is no way of discovering the nature of the self except in
terms of objective ends which fulfill its capacities, and
there is no <i>way</i> of realizing the self except as it is forgotten
in devotion to these objective ends.</p>

<p><b>1. Self-Realization as Consequence of Moral Action.</b>&mdash;Every
good act realizes the selfhood of the agent who performs
it; every bad act tends to the lowering or destruction
of selfhood. This truth is expressed in Kant's maxim
that every personality should be regarded as always an end,
never as a means, with its implication that a wrong intent
always reduces selfhood to the status of a mere tool or
device for securing some end beyond itself&mdash;the self-indulgent
man treating his personal powers as mere means to
securing ease, comfort, or pleasure. It is expressed by
ordinary moral judgment in its view that all immoral
action is a sort of prostitution, a lowering of the dignity
of the self to base ends. The destructive tendency of evil
deeds is witnessed also by our common language in its conception
of wrong as dissipation, dissoluteness, duplicity.
The bad character is one which is shaky, empty,
"naughty," unstable, gone to pieces, just as the good
man is straight, solid, four-square, sound, substantial.
This conviction that at bottom and in the end, in spite
of all temporary appearance to the contrary, the right
act effects a realization of the self, is also evidenced in
the common belief that virtue brings its own bliss. No
matter how much suffering from physical loss or from
material and mental inconvenience or loss of social repute
virtue may bring with it, the <i>quality of happiness</i> that
accompanies devotion to the right end is so unique,
so <i>invaluable</i>, that pains and discomforts do not weigh
in the balance. It is indeed possible to state this truth in
such an exaggerated perspective that it becomes false; but
taken just for what it is, it acknowledges that whatever
harm or loss a right act may bring to the self in some of
its aspects,&mdash;even extending to destruction of the bodily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
self,&mdash;the inmost moral self finds fulfillment and consequent
happiness in the good.</p>

<p><b>2. Self-Realization as Aim of Moral Action.</b>&mdash;This
realization of selfhood in the right course of action is,
however, not <i>the</i> end of a moral act&mdash;that is, it is not
the only end. The moral act is one which sustains a whole
complex system of social values; one which keeps vital
and progressive the industrial order, science, art, and the
State. The patriot who dies for his country may find
in that devotion his own supreme realization, but none the
less the aim of his act is precisely that for which he performs
it: the conservation of his nation. He dies <i>for</i> his
country, not <i>for</i> himself. He is what he would be in dying
for his country, not in dying for himself. To say that
his conscious aim is self-realization is to put the cart
before the horse. That his willingness to die for his country
proves that his country's good is taken by him to
constitute himself and his own good is true; but his aim
is his country's good <i>as constituting</i> his self-realization,
not the self-realization. It is impossible that genuine
artistic creation or execution should not be accompanied
with the joy of an expanding selfhood, but the artist
who thinks <i>of</i> himself and allows a view of himself to intervene
between his performance and its result, has the
embarrassment and awkwardness of "self-consciousness,"
which affects for the worse his artistic product. And it
makes little difference whether it is the thought of himself
as materially profiting, or as famous, or as technical
performer, or as benefiting the public, or as securing
his own complete artistic culture, that comes in between.
In any case, there is loss to the work, and loss in the
very thing taken as end, namely, development of his
own powers. The problem of morality, upon the intellectual
side, is the discovery of, the finding of, the self, in
the objective end to be striven for; and then upon the
overt practical side, it is the losing of the self in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
endeavor for the objective realization. This is the lasting
truth in the conception of self-abnegation, self-forgetfulness,
disinterested interest.</p>

<p><b>The Thought of Self-Realization.</b>&mdash;Since, however, the
realization of selfhood, the strengthening and perfecting
of capacity, is as matter of fact one phase of the objective
end, it may, <i>at times</i>, be definitely present in
thought as part of the foreseen consequences; and even,
<i>at times</i>, may be the most prominent feature of the conceived
results. The artist, for example a musician or
painter, may practice for the sake of acquiring skill, that
is, of developing capacity. In this case, the usual relationship
of objective work and personal power is reversed;
the product or performance being subordinated to the
perfecting of power, instead of power being realized in
the use it is put to. But the development of power is
not conceived as a final end, but as <i>desirable because of an
eventual more liberal and effective use</i>. It is matter of
temporary emphasis. Something of like nature occurs in
the moral life&mdash;not that one definitely rehearses or practices
moral deeds for the sake of acquiring more skill
and power. At times the effect upon the self of a deed
becomes the conspicuously controlling element in the forecast
of consequences. (See p. 382.) For example, a person
may realize that a certain act is trivial in its effects
upon others and in the changes it impresses upon the
world; and yet he may hesitate to perform it because he
realizes it would intensify some tendency of his own in
such a way as, in the delicate economy of character, to disturb
the proper balance of the springs to action. Or, on
the other hand, the agent may apprehend that some consequences
that are legitimate and important in themselves
involve, in their attainment, an improper sacrifice of personal
capacity. In such cases, the consideration of the
effect upon self-realization is not only permissible, but
imperative as <i>a part or phase of the total end</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Problem of Equating Personal and General Happiness.</b>&mdash;Much
moral speculation has been devoted to
the problem of equating personal happiness and regard for
the general good. Right moral action, it is assumed,
consists especially of justice and benevolence,&mdash;attitudes
which aim at the good of others. But, it is also assumed,
a just and righteous order of the universe requires
that the man who seeks the happiness of others should
also himself be a happy man. Much ingenuity has been
directed to explaining away and accounting for the seeming
discrepancies: the cases where men not conspicuous for
regard for others or for maintaining a serious and noble
view of life seem to maintain a banking-credit on the side
of happiness; while men devoted to others, men conspicuous
for range of sympathetic affections, seem to have a
debit balance. The problem is the more serious because
the respective good and ill fortunes do not seem to be
entirely accidental and external, but to come as results
from the moral factors in behavior. It would not be
difficult to build up an argument to show that while extreme
viciousness or isolated egoism is unfavorable to
happiness, so also are keenness and breadth of affections.
The argument would claim that the most comfortable
course of life is one in which the man cultivates enough
intimacies with enough persons to secure for himself their
support and aid, but avoids engaging his sympathies too
closely in their affairs and entangling himself in any associations
which would require self-sacrifice or exposure to
the sufferings of others: a course of life in which the
individual shuns those excesses of vice which injure health,
wealth, and lessen the decent esteem of others, but also
shuns enterprises of precarious virtue and devotion to
high and difficult ends.</p>

<p><b>Real and Artificial Aspects of the Problem.</b>&mdash;The
problem thus put seems insoluble, or soluble only upon
the supposition of some prolongation of life under condi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>tions
very different from those of the present, in which the
present lack of balance between happiness and goodness
will be redressed. <i>But the problem is insoluble because it
is artificial.</i><a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> It assumes a ready-made self and hence a
ready-made type of satisfaction of happiness. It is not
the business of moral theory to demonstrate the existence
of mathematical equations, in this life or another one, between
goodness and virtue. It is the business of men
to develop such capacities and desires, such selves as
render them capable of finding their own satisfaction,
their invaluable value, in fulfilling the demands which
grow out of their associated life. Such happiness may
be short in duration and slight in bulk: but that it outweighs
in quality all accompanying discomforts as well as
all enjoyments which may have been missed by not doing
something else, is attested by the simple fact that men do
consciously choose it. Such a person has found <i>himself</i>,
and has solved the problem in the only place and in the
only way in which it can be solved: <i>in action</i>. To demand
in advance of voluntary desire and deliberate choice that
it be demonstrated that an individual shall get happiness
in the measure of the rightness of his act, is to demand
the obliteration of the essential factor in morality:
the constant discovery, formation, and reformation of the
self in the ends which an individual is called upon to
sustain and develop in virtue of his membership in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
social whole. The solution of the problem through the
individual's voluntary identification of himself with social
relations and aims is neither rare nor utopian. It is
achieved not only by conspicuous social figures, but by
multitudes of "obscure" figures who are faithful to the
callings of their social relationships and offices. That the
conditions of life for all should be enlarged, that wider
opportunities and richer fields of activity should be opened,
in order that happiness may be of a more noble and variegated
sort, that those inequalities of status which lead men
to find their advantage in disregard of others should be
destroyed&mdash;these things are indeed necessary. But under
the most ideal conditions which can be imagined, if there
remain any moral element whatsoever, it will be only
through personal deliberation and personal preference as
to objective and social ends that the individual will discover
and constitute himself, and hence discover the sort
of happiness required as his good.</p>

<p>Our final word about the place of the self in the moral
life is, then, that the problem of morality is the formation,
out of the body of original instinctive impulses which compose
the natural self, of a voluntary self in which socialized
desires and affections are dominant, and in which the last
and controlling principle of deliberation is the love of the
objects which will make this transformation possible. If
we identify, as we must do, the interests of such a character
with the virtues, we may say with Spinoza that happiness
is not the reward of virtue, but is virtue itself. What,
then, are the virtues?</p>

opposite experience which proves that no evil thing brings happiness,"
one may well ask what more relation any reasonable man
would want. For it indicates that "goodness" consists in active
interest in those things which really bring happiness; and while
it by no means follows that this interest will <i>bring</i> even a preponderance
of pleasure over pain to the person, it is always open to him
to <i>find</i> and <i>take</i> his dominant happiness in making this interest
dominant in his life.</p></div>

<br /><br />

THE VIRTUES</h2>


<h4>INTRODUCTORY</h4>

<p><b>Definition of Virtue.</b>&mdash;It is upon the self, upon the
agent, that ultimately falls the burden of maintaining and
of extending the values which make life reasonable and
good. The worth of science, of art, of industry, of relationship
of man and wife, parent and child, teacher and
pupil, friend and friend, citizen and State, exists only as
there are characters consistently interested in such goods.
Hence any trait of character which makes for these
goods is esteemed; it is given positive value; while any
disposition of selfhood found to have a contrary tendency
is condemned&mdash;has negative value. The habits of character
whose effect is to sustain and spread the rational
or common good are virtues; the traits of character which
have the opposite effect are vices.</p>

<p><b>Virtue and Approbation; Vice and Condemnation.</b>&mdash;The
approbation and disapprobation visited upon conduct
are never purely intellectual. They are also emotional and
practical. We are stirred to hostility at whatever disturbs
the order of society; we are moved to admiring sympathy
of whatever makes for its welfare. And these emotions
express themselves in appropriate conduct. To disapprove
and dislike is to reprove, blame, and punish. To approve
is to encourage, to aid, and support. Hence the judgments
express the character of the one who utters them&mdash;they
are traits of his conduct and character; and they
react into the character of the agent upon whom they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
directed. They are part of the process of forming character.
The commendation is of the nature of a reward
calculated to confirm the person in the right course of
action. The reprobation is of the nature of punishment,
fitted to dissuade the agent from the wrong course. This
encouragement and blame are not necessarily of an external
sort; the reward and the punishment may not be
in material things. It is not from ulterior design that
society esteems and respects those attributes of an agent
which tend to its own peace and welfare; it is from natural,
instinctive response to acknowledge whatever makes for its
good. None the less, the social esteem, the honor which
attend certain acts inevitably educate the individual
who performs these acts, and they strengthen, emotionally
and practically, his interest in the right. Similarly,
there is an instinctive reaction of society against an
infringement of its customs and ideals; it naturally
"makes it hot" for any one who disturbs its values. And
this disagreeable attention instructs the individual as to
the consequences of his act, and works to hinder the formation
of dispositions of the socially disliked kind.</p>

<p><b>Natural Ability and Virtue.</b>&mdash;There is a tendency to
use the term virtue in an abstract "moralistic" sense&mdash;a
way which makes it almost Pharisaic in character. Hard
and fast lines are drawn between certain traits of character
labeled "virtues" and others called talents, natural
abilities, or gifts of nature. Apart from deliberate or
reflective nurture, modesty or generosity is no less and no
more a purely natural ability than is good-humor, a turn
for mechanics, or presence of mind. Every natural capacity,
every talent or ability, whether of inquiring mind,
of gentle affection or of executive skill, becomes a virtue
when it is turned to account in supporting or extending
the fabric of social values; and it turns, if not to vice
at least to delinquency, when not thus utilized. The important
habits conventionally reckoned virtues are barren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
unless they are the cumulative assemblage of a multitude
of anonymous interests and capacities. Such natural aptitudes
vary widely in different individuals. Their endowments
and circumstances occasion and exact different
virtues, and yet one person is not more or less virtuous
than another because his virtues take a different form.</p>

<p><b>Changes in Virtues.</b>&mdash;It follows also that the meaning,
or content, of virtues changes from time to time. Their
abstract form, the man's attitude towards the good, remains
the same. But when institutions and customs
change and natural abilities are differently stimulated and
evoked, ends vary, and habits of character are differently
esteemed both by the individual agent and by others who
judge. No social group could be maintained without
patriotism and chastity, but the actual meaning of chastity
and patriotism is widely different in contemporary
society from what it was in savage tribes or from what
we may expect it to be five hundred years from now. Courage
in one society may consist almost wholly in willingness
to face physical danger and death in voluntary devotion to
one's community; in another, it may be willingness to
support an unpopular cause in the face of ridicule.</p>

<p><b>Conventional and Genuine Virtue.</b>&mdash;When we take
these social changes on a broad scale, in the gross, the point
just made is probably clear without emphasis. But we are
apt to forget that minor changes are going on all the
while. The community's formulated code of esteem and
regard and praise at any given time is likely to lag somewhat
behind its practical level of achievement and possibility.
It is more or less traditional, describing what used
to be, rather than what are, virtues. The "respectable"
comes to mean tolerable, passable, conventional. Accordingly
the prevailing scheme of assigning merit and blame,
while on the whole a mainstay of moral guidance and instruction,
is also a menace to moral growth. Hence men
must look behind the current valuation to the real value.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
Otherwise, mere conformity to custom is conceived to be
virtue;<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and the individual who deviates from custom in
the interest of wider and deeper good is censured.</p>

<p><b>Moral Responsibility for Praise and Blame.</b>&mdash;The practical
assigning of value, of blame and praise, is a measure
and exponent of the character of the one from whom it
issues. In judging others, in commending and condemning,
we judge ourselves. What we find to be praiseworthy
and blameworthy is a revelation of our own affections.
Very literally the measure we mete to others is meted to
us. To be free in our attributions of blame is to be
censorious and uncharitable; to be unresentful to evil is to
be indifferent, or interested perhaps chiefly in one's own
popularity, so that one avoids giving offense to others.
To engage profusely in blame and approbation in speech
without acts which back up or attack the ends verbally
honored or condemned, is to have a perfunctory morality.
To cultivate complacency and remorse apart from effort
to improve is to indulge in sentimentality. In short, to
approve or to condemn is itself a moral act for which we
are as much responsible as we are for any other deed.</p>

<p><b>Impossibility of Cataloguing Virtues.</b>&mdash;These last three
considerations: (1) the intimate connection of virtues with
all sorts of individual capacities and endowments, (2) the
change in types of habit required with change of social
customs and institutions, (3) the dependence of judgment
of vice and virtue upon the character of the one judging,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
make undesirable and impossible a catalogued list of vir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>tues
with an exact definition of each. Virtues are numberless.
Every situation, not of a routine order,
brings in some special shading, some unique adaptation,
of disposition.</p>

<p><b>Twofold Classification.</b>&mdash;We may, however, classify
the chief institutions of social life&mdash;language, scientific investigation,
artistic production, industrial efficiency, family,
local community, nation, humanity&mdash;and specify the
types of mental disposition and interest which are fitted to
maintain them flourishingly; or, starting from typical impulsive
and instinctive tendencies, we may consider the
form they assume when they become intelligently exercised
habits. A virtue may be defined, accordingly, either as
<i>the settled intelligent identification of an agent's capacity
with some aspect of the reasonable or common happiness</i>;
or, as <i>a social custom or tendency organized into a personal
habit of valuation</i>. From the latter standpoint,
truthfulness is the social institution of language maintained
at its best pitch of efficiency through the habitual
purposes of individuals; from the former, it is an instinctive
capacity and tendency to communicate emotions
and ideas directed so as to maintain social peace and
prosperity. In like fashion, one might catalogue all forms
of social custom and institution on one hand; and all the
species and varieties of individual equipment on the other,
and enumerate a virtue for each. But the performance is
so formal as not to amount to much.</p>

<p><b>Aspects of Virtue.</b>&mdash;Any virtuous disposition of character
exhibits, however, certain main traits, a consideration
of which will serve to review and summarize our analysis
of the moral life.</p>

<p><b>I. The Interest Must be Entire or Whole-hearted.</b>&mdash;The
whole self, without division or reservation, must go
out into the proposed object and find therein its own satisfaction.
Virtue is integrity; vice duplicity. Goodness is
straight, right; badness is crooked, indirect. Interest that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
is incomplete is not interest, but (so far as incomplete) indifference
and disregard. This totality of interest we call
affection, love; and love is the fulfilling of the law. A
grudging virtue is next to no virtue at all; thorough heartiness
in even a bad cause stirs admiration, and lukewarmness
in every direction is always despised as meaning lack
of character. Surrender, abandonment, is of the essence
of identification of self with an object.</p>

<p><b>II. The Interest Must be Energetic and Hence Persistent.</b>&mdash;One
swallow does not make a summer nor a sporadic
right act a virtuous habit. Fair-weather character
has a proverbially bad name. Endurance through discouragement,
through good repute and ill, weal and woe, tests
the vigor of interest in the good, and both builds up and
expresses a formed character.</p>

<p><b>III. The Interest Must be Pure or Sincere.</b>&mdash;Honesty
is, doubtless, the best policy, and it is better a man should
be honest from policy than not honest at all. If genuinely
honest from considerations of prudence, he is on the road
to learn better reasons for honesty. None the less, we are
suspicious of a man if we believe that motives of personal
profit are the only stay of his honesty. For circumstances
might arise in which, in the exceptional case, it would be
clear that personal advantage lay in dishonesty. The motive
for honesty would hold in most cases, in ordinary and
routine circumstances and in the glare of publicity, but
not in the dark of secrecy, or in the turmoil of disturbed
circumstance. The eye single to the good, the "disinterested
interest" of moralists, is required. The motive
that has to be coaxed or coerced to its work by some
promise or threat is imperfect.</p>

<p><b>Cardinal or Indispensable Aspects of Virtue.</b>&mdash;Bearing
in mind that we are not attempting to classify various
acts or habits, but only to state traits essential to all morality,
we have the "cardinal virtues" of moral theory.
As whole-hearted, as complete interest, any habit or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
attitude of character involves justice and love; as persistently
active, it is courage, fortitude, or vigor; as unmixed
and single, it is temperance&mdash;in its classic sense.
And since no habitual interest can be integral, enduring,
or sincere, save as it is reasonable, save, that is, as it is
rooted in the deliberate habit of viewing the part in the
light of the whole, the present in the light of the past and
future, interest in the good is also wisdom or conscientiousness:&mdash;interest
in the discovery of the true good of
the situation. Without this interest, all our interest is
likely to be perverted and misleading&mdash;requiring to be
repented of.</p>

<p>Wisdom, or (in modern phrase) conscientiousness, is the
nurse of all the virtues. Our most devoted courage is in
the will to know the good and the fair by unflinching attention
to the painful and disagreeable. Our severest discipline
in self-control is that which checks the exorbitant
pretensions of an appetite by insisting upon knowing it in
its true proportions. The most exacting justice is that of
an intelligence which gives due weight to each desire and
demand in deliberation before it is allowed to pass into
overt action. That affection and wisdom lie close to each
other is evidenced by our language; thoughtfulness, regard,
consideration for others, recognition of others,
attention to others.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. TEMPERANCE</h4>

<p>The English word "temperance" (particularly in its
local association with agitation regarding use of intoxicating
liquors) is a poor substitute for the Greek <i>sophrosyne</i>
which, through the Latin <i>temperantia</i>, it represents.
The Athenian Greek was impressed with the fact that just
as there are lawless, despotically ruled, and self-governed
communities, so there are lawless, and servile, and self-ruled
individuals. Whenever there is a self-governed soul,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
there is a happy blending of the authority of reason with
the force of appetite. The individual's diverse nature is
tempered into a living harmony of desire and intelligence.
Reason governs not as a tyrant from without, but as a
guide to which the impulses and emotions are gladly responsive.
Such a well-attuned nature, as far from asceticism
on one side as from random indulgence on the other,
represented the ideal of what was fair and graceful in
character, an ideal embodied in the notion of <i>sophrosyne</i>.
This was a <i>whole-mindedness</i> which resulted from the
happy furtherance of all the elements of human nature
under the self-accepted direction of intelligence. It implied
an <i>&aelig;sthetic</i> view of character; of harmony in
structure and rhythm in action. It was the virtue of
judgment exercised in the estimate of pleasures:&mdash;since
it is the agreeable, the pleasant, which gives an end
excessive hold upon us.</p>

<p><b>Roman Temperantia.</b>&mdash;The Roman conceived this virtue
under the term <i>temperantia</i>, which conveys the same
idea, but accommodated to the Roman genius. It is connected
with the word <i>tempus</i>, time, which is connected also
with a root meaning divide, distribute; it suggests a consecutive
orderliness of behavior, a freedom from excessive
and reckless action, first this way, and then that. It means
seemliness, decorum, decency. It was "moderation," not
as quantity of indulgence, but as a moderating of each act
in a series by the thought of other and succeeding acts&mdash;keeping
each in sequence with others in a whole. The idea
of time involves time to think; the sobering second thought
expressed in seriousness and gravity. The negative side,
the side of restraint, of inhibition, is strong, and functions
for the consistent calm and gravity of life.</p>

<p><b>Christian Purity.</b>&mdash;Through the Christian influence, the
connotation which is marked in the notion of control of
sexual appetite, became most obvious&mdash;<i>purity</i>. Passion is
not so much something which disturbs the harmony of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
man's nature, or which interrupts its orderliness, as it is
something which defiles the purity of spiritual nature. It
is the grossness, the contamination of appetite which is
insisted upon, and temperance is the maintenance of the
soul spotless and unsullied.</p>

<p><b>Negative Phase</b>:&mdash;Self-control. A negative aspect of
self-control, restraint, inhibition is everywhere involved.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
It is not, however, desire, or appetite, or passion, or impulse,
which has to be checked (much less eliminated); it
is rather that tendency of desire and passion so to engross
attention as to destroy our sense of the other ends which
have a claim upon us. This moderation of pretension is
indispensable for every desire. In one direction, it is modesty,
humility; the restraint of the tendency of self-conceit
to distort the relative importance of the agent's and others'
concerns; in another direction, it is chastity; in another,
"temperance" in the narrower sense of that word&mdash;keeping
the indulgence of hunger and thirst from passing reasonable
bounds; in another, it is calmness, self-possession&mdash;moderation
of the transporting power of excitement; in
yet another, it is discretion, imposing limits upon the use
of the hand, eye, or tongue. In matters of wealth, it is
decent regulation of display and ostentation. In general,
it is prudence, control of the present impulse and desire
by a view of the "long run," of proximate by remote
consequences.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p><b>Positive Phase: Reverence.</b>&mdash;The tendency of dominant
passion is to rush us along, to prevent our thinking.
The one thing that desire emphasizes is, for the time being,
the most important thing in the universe. This is necessary
to heartiness and effectiveness of interest and be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>havior.
But it is important that the thing which thus absorbs
desire should be an end capable of justifying its
power to absorb. This is possible only if it expresses the
entire self. Otherwise capacities and desires which will
occur later will be inconsistent and antagonistic, and
conduct will be unregulated and unstable. The underlying
idea in "temperance" is then a care of details for the
sake of the whole course of behavior of which they are
parts; heedfulness, painstaking devotion. Laxness in conduct
means carelessness; lack of regard for the whole life
permits temporary inclinations to get a sway that the
outcome will not justify. In its more striking forms,
we call this care and respect <i>reverence</i>; recognition of the
unique, invaluable worth embodied in any situation or
act of life, a recognition which checks that flippancy of
surrender to momentary excitement coming from a superficial
view of behavior. A sense of momentous issues
at stake means a sobering and deepening of the mental
attitude. The consciousness that every deed of
life has an import clear beyond its immediate, or first
significance, attaches dignity to every act. To live
in the sense of the larger values attaching to our passing
desires and deeds is to be possessed by the virtue of
temperance.</p>

<p><b>Control of Excitement.</b>&mdash;What hinders such living is,
as we have seen, the exaggerated intensity, the lack of proportion
and perspective, with which any appetite or desire
is likely to present itself. It is this which moralists of
all ages have attacked under the name of pleasure&mdash;the alluring
and distracting power of the momentarily agreeable.
Seeing in this the enemy which prevents the rational
survey of the whole field and the calm, steady insight into
the true good, it is hardly surprising that moralists have
attacked "pleasure" as the source of every temptation to
stray from the straight path of reason. But it is not
pleasure, it is one form of pleasure, the <i>pleasure of excite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>ment</i>,
which is the obstacle and danger.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Every impulse
and desire marks a certain disturbance in the order of
life, an exaltation above the existing level, a pressure
beyond its existing limit. To give way to desire, to let it
grow, to taste to the full its increasing and intensifying
excitement, is the temptation. The bodily appetites of
hunger and thirst and sex, with which we associate the
grossest forms of indulgence and laxity, exemplify the
principle of expanding waves of organic stimulation. But
so also do many of the subtler forms of unrestraint or intemperate
action. The one with a clever and lively tongue
is tempted to let it run away with him; the vain man
feeds upon the excitement of a personality heightened by
display and the notice of others; the angry man, even
though he knows he will later regret his surrender, gives
away to the sense of expanding power coincident with
his discharge of rage. The shiftless person finds it easier
to take chances and let consequences take care of themselves,
while he enjoys local and casual stimulations. Trivialities
and superficialities entangle us in a flippant life,
because each one as it comes promises to be "thrilling,"
while the very fear that this promise will not
be kept hurries us on to new experiences. To think of
alternatives and consequences is not "thrilling," but
serious.</p>

<p><b>Necessity of Superior Interest.</b>&mdash;Now calculation of
the utilitarian type is not adequate to deal with this temptation.
Those who are prone to reflection upon results
are just those who are least likely to be carried away by
excitement&mdash;unless, as is the case with some specialists,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
thinking is itself the mode of indulgence in excitement.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
With those who are carried away habitually by some mode
of excitement, the disease and the incapacity to take the
proffered remedy of reflection are the same thing. Only
some <i>other</i> passion will accomplish the desired control.
With the Greeks, it was &aelig;sthetic passion, love of the grace
and beauty, the rhythm and harmony, of a self-controlled
life. With the Romans, it was the passion for dignity,
power, honor of personality, evidenced in rule of appetite.
Both of these motives remain among the strong allies of
ordered conduct. But the passion for purity, the sense
of something degrading and foul in surrender to the base,
an interest in something spotless, free from adulteration,
are, in some form or other, the chief resource in overcoming
the tendency of excitement to usurp the governance
of the self.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 2. COURAGE<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> OR PERSISTENT VIGOR</h4>

<p>While love of excitement allures man from the path of
reason, fear of pain, dislike to hardship, and laborious
effort, hold him back from entering it. Dislike of the disagreeable
inhibits or contracts the putting forth of energy,
just as liking for agreeable stimulation discharges and
exhausts it. Intensity of active interest in the good alone
subdues that instinctive shrinking from the unpleasant
and hard which slackens energy or turns it aside. Such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
energy of devotion is courage. Its etymological connection
with the Latin word for <i>heart</i>, suggests a certain
abundant spontaneity, a certain overflow of positive
energy; the word was applied to this aspect of virtue when
the heart was regarded as literally (not metaphorically)
the seat of vital impulse and abundant forcefulness.</p>

<p><b>Courage and the Common Good.</b>&mdash;One of the problems
of early Greek thought was that of discriminating
courage as virtuous from a sort of animal keenness and
alacrity, easily running into recklessness and bravado. It
was uniformly differentiated from mere overflow of physical
energy by the fact that it was exhibited in support of
some common or social good. It bore witness to its voluntary
character by abiding in the face of threatened evil.
Its simplest form was patriotism&mdash;willingness to brave the
danger of death in facing the country's enemy from love
of country. And this basic largeness of spirit in which
the individual sinks considerations of personal loss and
harm in allegiance to an objective good remains a cardinal
aspect of all right disposition.</p>

<p><b>Courage is Pre&euml;minently the Executive Side of Every
Virtue.</b>&mdash;The good will, as we saw, means endeavor, effort,
towards certain ends; unless the end stirs to strenuous exertion,
it is a sentimental, not a moral or practical end. And
endeavor implies obstacles to overcome, resistance to what
diverts, painful labor. It is the degree of threatened harm&mdash;in
spite of which one does not swerve&mdash;which measures
this depth and sincerity of interest in the good.</p>

<p><b>Aspects of Interest in Execution.</b>&mdash;Certain formal
traits of courage follow at once from this general definition.
In its onset, willingness in behalf of the common
good to endure attendant private evils is alacrity, promptness.
In its abiding and unswerving devotion, it is constancy,
loyalty, and faithfulness. In its continual resistance
to evil, it is fortitude, patience, perseverance, willingness
to abide for justification an ultimate issue. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
<i>totality</i> of commitment of self to the good is decision and
firmness. Conviction and resolution accompany all true
moral endeavor. These various dimensions (intensity, duration,
extent, and fullness) are, however, only differing
expressions of one and the same attitude of vigorous, energetic
identification of agency with the object.</p>

<p><b>Goodness and Effectiveness.</b>&mdash;It is the failure to give
due weight to this factor of morality (the "works" of theological
discussion) which is responsible for the not uncommon
idea that moral goodness means loss of practical efficacy.
When inner disposition is severed from outer action,
wishing divorced from executive willing, morality is
reduced to mere harmlessness; outwardly speaking, the best
that can then be said of virtue is that it is innocent and
innocuous. Unscrupulousness is identified with energy of
execution; and a minute and paralyzing scrupulosity with
goodness. It is in reaction from such futile morality that
the gospel of force and of shrewdness of selecting and
adapting means to the desired end, is preached and gains
hearers&mdash;as in the Italy of the Renaissance<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> in reaction
against medi&aelig;val piety, and again in our own day (see
<i>ante</i>, p. 374).</p>

<p><b>Moral Courage and Optimism.</b>&mdash;A characteristic modern
development of courageousness is implied in the phrase
"moral courage,"&mdash;as if all genuine courage were not
moral. It means devotion to the good in the face of the
customs of one's friends and associates, rather than against
the attacks of one's enemies. It is willingness to brave
for sake of a new idea of the good the unpopularity that
attends breach of custom and convention. It is this
type of heroism, manifested in integrity of memory and
foresight, which wins the characteristic admiration of
to-day, rather than the outward heroism of bearing
wounds and undergoing physical dangers. It is <i>attention</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
upon which the stress falls.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> This supplies, perhaps,
the best vantage point from which to survey optimism
and pessimism in their direct moral bearings. The individual
whose pursuit of the good is colored by honest
recognition of existing and threatening evils is almost always
charged with being a pessimist; with cynical delight
in dwelling upon what is morbid, base, or sordid; and he is
urged to be an "optimist," meaning in effect to conceal
from himself and others evils that obtain. Optimism, thus
conceived, is a combination of building rosy-colored castles
in the air and hiding, ostrich-like, from actual facts.
As a general thing, it will be those who have some interest
at stake in evils remaining unperceived, and hence unremedied,
who most clamor in the cause of such "optimism."
Hope and aspiration, belief in the supremacy of good in
spite of all evil, belief in the realizability of good in spite
of all obstacles, are necessary inspirations in the life of
virtue. The good can never be demonstrated to the senses,
nor be proved by calculations of personal profit. It involves
a radical venture of the will in the interest of what is
unseen and prudentially incalculable. But such optimism
of <i>will</i>, such determination of the man that, so far as his
choice is concerned, only the good shall be recognized as
real, is very different from a sentimental refusal to look at
the realities of the situation just as they are. In fact a certain
intellectual pessimism, in the sense of a steadfast willingness
to uncover sore points, to acknowledge and search
for abuses, to note how presumed good often serves as a
cloak for actual bad, is a necessary part of the moral optimism
which actively devotes itself to making the right
prevail. Any other view reduces the aspiration and hope,
which are the essence of moral courage, to a cheerful animal
buoyancy; and, in its failure to see the evil done to
others in its thoughtless pursuit of what it calls good, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
nextdoor to brutality, to a brutality bathed in the atmosphere
of sentimentality and flourishing the catchwords of
idealism.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. JUSTICE</h4>

<p><b>In Ethical Literature Justice Has Borne at Least
Three Different Senses.</b><a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>&mdash;In its widest sense, it means
righteousness, uprightness, rectitude. It sums up morality.
It is not <i>a</i> virtue, but it is virtue. The just act is
the <i>due</i> act; justice is fulfillment of obligation. (2) This
passes over into fairness, equity, impartiality, honesty in
all one's dealing with others. (3) The narrowest meaning
is that of <i>vindication</i> of right through the administration
of law.<a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Since Aristotle's time (and following his treatment)
this has been divided into (i.) the <i>distributive</i>, having
to do with the assignment of honor, wealth, etc., in proportion
to desert, and (ii.) the <i>corrective</i>, vindicating the
law against the transgressor by effecting a requital, redress,
which restores the supremacy of law.</p>

<p><b>A Thread of Common Significance Runs through
These Various Meanings.</b>&mdash;The rational good means a
comprehensive or complete end, in which are harmoniously
included a variety of special aims and values. The just
man is the man who takes in the whole of a situation and
reacts to it in its wholeness, not being misled by undue
respect to some particular factor. Since the general or
inclusive good is a common or social good, reconciling and
combining the ends of a multitude of private or particular
persons, justice is the pre&euml;minently social virtue: that
which maintains the due order of individuals in the interest
of the comprehensive or social unity.</p>

<p>Justice, as equity, fairness, impartiality, honesty,
carries the recognition of the whole over into the question
of right distribution and apportionment among its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
parts. The equitable judge or administrator is the one
who makes no unjustifiable distinctions among those dealt
with. A fair price is one which recognizes the rights of
both buyer and seller. An honest man is the one who, with
respect to whatever he has to distribute to others and to
receive from them, is desirous of giving and taking just
what belongs to each party concerned. The fair-minded
man is not bribed by pleasure into giving undue importance
to some element of good nor coerced by fear of pain
into ignoring some other. He <i>distributes</i> his attention,
regard, and attachment according to the reasonable or
objective claims of each factor.</p>

<p><b>Justice and Sympathy or Love.</b>&mdash;The most significant
questions regarding justice are as to its connection with
love and with condemnation and punishment. It is a common
notion that justice is harsh or hard in its workings and
that it requires to be supplemented, if not replaced, by
mercy. Taken literally this would mean that justice
is not just in its workings. The truth contained is that
what is frequently regarded as justice is not justice, but
an imperfect substitute for it. When a legal type of morality
is current, justice is regarded as the working of
some fixed and abstract law; it is the law as law which is
to be reverenced; it is law as law whose majesty is to be
vindicated. It is forgotten that the nobility and dignity
of law are due to the place of law in securing the order
involved in the realization of human happiness. Then the
law instead of being a servant of the good is put arbitrarily
above it, as if man was made for law, not law for
man. The result is inevitably harshness; indispensable
factors of happiness are ruthlessly slighted, or ruled out;
the loveliness and grace of behavior responding freely
and flexibly to the requirements of unique situations are
stiffened into uniformity. The formula <i>summum jus
summa injuria</i> expresses the outcome when abstract law
is insisted upon without reference to the needs of con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>crete
cases. Under such conditions, there arises a demand
for tempering the sternness of justice with mercy, and
supplementing the severity of law with grace. This demand
means that the neglected human values shall be
restored into the idea of what is just.</p>

<p><b>"Social Justice."</b>&mdash;Our own time has seen a generous
quickening of the idea of social justice due to the growth
of love, or philanthropy, as a working social motive. In
the older scheme of morals, justice was supposed to meet
all the necessary requirements of virtue; charity was doing
good in ways not obligatory or strictly exacted. Hence
it was a source of peculiar merit in the doer, a means of
storing up a surplus of virtue to offset vice. But a
more generous sense of inherent social relationships binding
the aims of all into one comprehensive good, which
is the result of increase of human intercourse, democratic
institutions, and biological science, has made men recognize
that the greater part of the sufferings and miseries
which afford on the part of a few the opportunity for
charity (and hence superior merit), are really social inequities,
due to causes which may be remedied. That justice
requires radical improvement of these conditions displaces
the notion that their effects may be here and there
palliated by the voluntary merit of morally superior individuals.
The change illustrates, on a wide scale, the
transformation of the conception of justice so that it joins
hands with love and sympathy. That human nature should
have justice done it under all circumstances is an infinitely
complicated and difficult requirement, and only a vision
of the capacities and accomplishments of human beings
rooted in affection and sympathy can perceive and execute
justly.</p>

<p><b>Transformation of Punitive Justice.</b>&mdash;The conception
of punitive or corrective justice is undergoing the same
transformation. Aristotle stated the rule of equity in
the case of wrongdoing as an arithmetical requital: the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
individual was to suffer according to his deed. Later,
through conjunction with the idea of a divine judge inflicting
retribution upon the sinner, this notion passed into
the belief that punishment is a form of justice restoring
the balance of disturbed law by inflicting suffering upon
the one who has done wrong. The end and aim of punishment
was retribution, bringing back to the agent the evil
consequences of his own deed. That punishment is suffering,
that it inevitably involves pain to the guilty one, there
can be no question; this, whether the punishment is externally
inflicted or is in the pangs of conscience, and
whether administered by parent, teacher, or civil authority.
But that suffering is for the sake of suffering, or
that suffering can in any way restore or affect the violated
majesty of law, is a different matter.</p>

<p>What erring human nature deserves or merits, it is just
it should have. But in the end, a moral agent deserves
to <i>be</i> a moral agent; and hence deserves that punishments
inflicted should be <i>corrective</i>, not merely retributive.
Every wrongdoer should have his due. But what is his
due? Can we measure it by his past alone; or is it due
every one to regard him as a man with a future as well?
as having possibilities for good as well as achievements in
bad? Those who are responsible for the infliction of punishment
have, as well as those punished, to meet the requirements
of justice; and failure to employ the means
and instrumentalities of punishment in a way to lead, so
far as possible, the wrongdoer to reconsideration of conduct
and re-formation of disposition, cannot shelter itself
under the plea that it vindicates law. Such failure comes
rather from thoughtless custom; from a lazy unwillingness
to find better means; from an admixture of pride
with lack of sympathy for others; from a desire to maintain
things as they are rather than go to the causes which
generate criminals.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 4. WISDOM OR CONSCIENTIOUSNESS</h4>

<p>As we have repeatedly noted, the heart of a voluntary
act is its intelligent or deliberate character. The individual's
<i>intelligent</i> concern for the good is implied in his
sincerity, his faithfulness, and his integrity. Of all the
habits which constitute the character of an individual, the
habit of <i>judging</i> moral situations is the most important,
for this is the key to the <i>direction</i> and to the <i>remaking</i> of
all other habits. When an act is overt, it is irretrievably
launched. The agent has no more control. The moral
life has its center in the periods of suspended and postponed
action, when the energy of the individual is spent
in recollection and foresight, in severe inquiry and serious
consideration of alternative aims. Only through reflection
can habits, however good in their origin and past exercise,
be readapted to the needs of the present; only through
reflection can impulses, not yet having found direction, be
guided into the haven of a reasonable happiness.</p>

<p><b>Greek Emphasis upon Insight or Wisdom.</b>&mdash;It is not
surprising that the Greeks, the first seriously to inquire
into the nature of behavior and its end or good, should
have eulogized <i>wisdom</i>, <i>insight</i>, as the supreme virtue and
the source of all the virtues. Now, indeed, it seems paradoxical
to say with Socrates that ignorance is the only
vice; that man is bad not voluntarily, from deliberate
choice, but only from ignorance. But this is largely because
we discriminate between different kinds of knowledge
as the Greek did not, and as they had no occasion for
doing. We have a second-hand knowledge, a knowledge
from books, newspapers, etc., which was practically non-existent
even in the best days of Athens. Knowledge meant
to them something more personal; something like what we
call a "realizing sense"; an intimate and well-founded conviction.
To us knowledge suggests information about what
others have found out, and hence is more remote in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
meaning. Greek knowledge was mostly directly connected
with the affairs of their common associated life. The very
words for knowledge and art, understanding and skill, were
hardly separated. Knowledge was knowledge about the
city, its traditions, literature, history, customs, purposes,
etc. Their astronomy was connected with their civic religion;
their geography with their own topography; their
mathematics with their civil and military pursuits. Now
we have immense bodies of impersonal knowledge, remote
from direct bearing upon affairs. Knowledge has accordingly
subdivided itself into theoretical or scientific and
practical or moral. We use the term knowledge usually
only for the first kind; hence the Socratic position seems
gratuitously paradoxical. But under the titles of <i>conscience</i>
and <i>conscientiousness</i> we preserve the meaning
which was attached to the term knowledge. It is not paradoxical
to say that unconscientiousness is the fundamental
vice, and genuine conscientiousness is guarantee of all
virtue.</p>

<p><b>Conscientiousness.</b>&mdash;In this change from Greek wisdom
to modern conscientiousness there have been some loss and
some gain. The loss lies in a certain hardening of the
idea of insight and deliberation, due to the isolation of the
moral good from the other goods of life. The good man
and the bad man have been endowed with the same faculty;
and this faculty has been treated as automatically delivering
correct conclusions. On the other hand, modern conscientiousness
contains less of the idea of intellectual accomplishment,
and more of the idea of interest in finding
out the good in conduct. "Wisdom" tended to emphasize
achieved insight; knowledge which was proved, guaranteed,
and unchangeable. "Conscientiousness" tends rather
to fix attention upon that voluntary attitude which is
interested in <i>discovery</i>.</p>

<p>This implies a pretty radical change in wisdom as virtue.
In the older sense it is an attainment; something possessed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
In the modern, it resides in the active desire and effort,
in pursuit rather than in possession. The <i>attainment</i> of
knowledge varies with original intellectual endowment;
with opportunity for leisurely reflection; with all sorts of
external conditions. Possession is a <i>class</i> idea and tends to
mark off a moral aristocracy from a common herd. Since
the activities of the latter must be directed, on this assumption,
by attained knowledge, its practical outcome is
the necessity of the regulation of their conduct by the
wisdom possessed by the superior class. When, however,
the morally important thing is the desire and effort to
discover the good, every one is on the same plane, in spite
of differences in intellectual endowment and in learning.</p>

<p>Moral knowing, as a fundamental or cardinal aspect of
virtue, is then the completeness of the interest in good
exhibited in effort to discover the good. Since knowing
involves two factors, a direct and an indirect, conscientiousness
involves both <i>sensitiveness</i> and <i>reflectiveness</i>.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p><b>(1) Moral Sensitiveness.</b>&mdash;The individual who is not
directly aware of the presence of values needing to be perpetuated
or achieved, in the things and persons about him,
is hard and callous or tough. A "tender" conscience is one
which is immediately responsive to the presentation of good
and evil. The modern counterpart to the Socratic doctrine
that ignorance is the root of vice, is that being
morally "cold" or "dead," being indifferent to moral distinctions,
is the most hopeless of all conditions. One who
cares, even if he cares in the wrong way, has at least a
spring that may be touched; the one who is just irresponsive
offers no leverage for correction or improvement.</p>

<p><b>(2) Thoughtfulness.</b>&mdash;While the possession of such
an immediate, unreflective responsiveness to elements of
good and bad must be the mainstay of moral wisdom, the
character which lies back of these intuitive apprehensions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
must be thoughtful and serious-minded. There is no individual
who, however morally sensitive, can dispense with
cool, calm reflection, or whose intuitive judgments, if
reliable, are not largely the funded outcome of prior
thinking. Every voluntary act is intelligent: i.e., includes
an idea of the end to be reached or the consequences to
accrue. Such ends are ideal in the sense that they are
present to thought, not to sense. But special ends, because
they are limited, are not what we mean by ideals.
They are specific. With the growth of the habit of reflection,
agents become conscious that the values of their particular
ends are not circumscribed, but extend far beyond
the special case in question; so far indeed that their range
of influence cannot be foreseen or defined. A kindly act
may not only have the particular consequence of relieving
present suffering, but may make a difference in the entire
life of its recipient, or may set in radically different directions
the interest and attention of the one who performs it.
These larger and remoter values in any moral act transcend
the end which was consciously present to its doer.
The person has always to aim at something definite, but
as he becomes aware of this penumbra or atmosphere of
far-reaching ulterior values the meaning of his special act
is thereby deepened and widened. An act is outwardly
temporary and circumstantial, but its meaning is permanent
and expansive. The act passes away; but its significance
abides in the increment of meaning given to
further growth. To live in the recognition of this deeper
meaning of acts is to live in the ideal, in the only sense
in which it is profitable for man to dwell in the ideal.</p>

<p><i>Our "ideals," our types of excellence, are the various
ways in which we figure to ourselves the outreaching and
ever-expanding values of our concrete acts.</i> Every
achievement of good deepens and quickens our sense of
the inexhaustible value contained in every right act. With
achievement, our conception of the possible goods of life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
increases, and we find ourselves called to live upon a still
deeper and more thoughtful plane. An ideal is not some
remote all-exhaustive goal, a fixed <i>summum bonum</i> with
respect to which other things are only means. It is not
something to be placed in contrast to the direct, local,
and tangible quality of our actual situations, so that by
contrast these latter are lightly esteemed as insignificant.
On the contrary, an ideal is the conviction that each of
these special situations carries with it a final value, a meaning
which in itself is unique and inexhaustible. To set up
"ideals" of perfection which are other than the serious
recognition of the possibilities of development resident
in each concrete situation, is in the end to pay ourselves
with sentimentalities, if not with words, and meanwhile
it is to direct thought and energy away from the situations
which need and which welcome the perfecting care of
attention and affection.</p>

<p><b>Thoughtfulness and Progress.</b>&mdash;This sense of wider
values than those definitely apprehended or definitely attained
is a constant warning to the individual not to be
content with an accomplishment. Conscientiousness takes
more and more the form of interest in improvement, in
progress. Conscientiousness as sensitiveness may rest upon
the plane of already secured satisfactions, upon discriminating
with accuracy their quality and degree. As
thoughtfulness, it will always be on the lookout for the
better. The good man not only measures his acts by a
standard, but he is concerned to revise his standard. His
sense of the ideal, of the undefinable because ever-expanding
value of special deeds, forbids his resting satisfied with
any formulated standard; for the very formulation gives
the standard a technical quality, while the good can be
maintained only in enlarging excellence. The highest form
of conscientiousness is interest in constant progress.</p>

<p><b>Love and Courage Required for Thoughtfulness.</b>&mdash;We
may close this chapter by repeating what we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
already noted, that genuine moral knowledge involves the
affections and the resolute will as well as the intelligence.
We cannot know the varied elements of value in the lives
of others and in the possibilities of our own, save as our
affections are strong. Every narrowing of love, every
encroachment of egoism, means just so much blindness
to the good. The man who pleads "good motives" as excuse
for acts which injure others is always one whose absorption
in himself has wrought harm to his powers of perception.
Every widening of contact with others, every deepening
of the level of sympathetic acquaintance, magnifies in
so much vision of the good. Finally, the chief ally of
moral thoughtfulness is the resolute courage of willingness
to face the evil for the sake of the good. Shrinking
from apprehension of the evil to others consequent upon
our behavior, because such realization would demand painful
effort to change our own plans and habits, maintains
habitual dimness and narrowness of moral vision.</p>

degree) of every temptation to turn from the straight and narrow
path. Virtue seems dull and sober, uninteresting, in comparison
with the increasing excitation of some desire. There are as many
forms of excitement as there are individual men.</p></div>

SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AND THE INDIVIDUAL</h2>


<p><b>Object of Part and Chapter.</b>&mdash;The history of morals
manifests a twofold movement. It reveals, on one side,
constantly increasing stress on <i>individual</i> intelligence and
affection. The transformation of customary into reflective
morals is the change from "Do those things which our
kin, class, or city do" to "Be a person with certain habits
of desire and deliberation." The moral history of the race
also reveals constantly growing emphasis upon the <i>social</i>
nature of the objects and ends to which personal preferences
are to be devoted. While the agent has been learning
that it is his personal attitude which counts in his
deeds, he has also learnt that there is no attitude which is
exclusively private in scope, none which does not need to
be socially valued or judged. Theoretic analysis enforces
the same lesson as history. It tells us that moral quality
<i>resides in</i> the habitual dispositions of an agent; and that
it <i>consists of</i> the tendency of these dispositions to secure
(or hinder) values which are sociably shared or sharable.</p>

<p>In Part One we sketched the historical course of this development;
in Part Two we traced its theoretic analysis. In
the present and concluding Part, our purpose is to consider
the distinctively social aspects of morality. We shall
consider how social institutions and tendencies supply
value to the activities of individuals, impose the conditions
of the formation and exercise of their desires and aims;
and, especially, how they create the peculiarly urgent
problems of contemporary moral life. The present chap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>ter
will take up the general question, that of the relation
of social organization to individual life.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. GROWTH OF INDIVIDUALITY THROUGH SOCIAL
ORGANIZATIONS</h4>

<p>From one point of view, historic development represents
the increasing liberation of individual powers from rigid
social control. Sir John Lubbock remarks: "No savage
is free. All over the world his daily life is regulated by a
complicated and apparently most inconvenient set of customs
(as forcible as laws), of quaint prohibitions and
privileges." Looked at from another point of view, emancipation
from one sort of social organization means initiation
into some other social order; the individual is liberated
from a small and fixed (customary) social group, to become
a member of a larger and progressive society. The
history of setting free individual power in desire, thought,
and initiative is, upon the whole, the history of the formation
of more complex and extensive social organizations.
Movements that look like the disintegration of the order
of society, when viewed with reference to what has preceded
them, are factors in the construction of a new social
order, which allows freer play to individuals, and yet
increases the number of social groupings and the depth of
social combinations.</p>

<p>This fact of historical development is well summed up in
the following words of Hobhouse, set forth as a summary
of a comprehensive survey of the historic development of
law and justice, of the family including the status of
women and children, of the relations between communities,
and between classes, the rich and the poor.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He says: "Amid all the variety of social institutions and the
ebb and flow of historical change, it is possible in the end to
detect a double movement, marking the transition from the
lower to the higher levels of civilized law and custom. On the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
one hand, the social order is strengthened and extended....
On this side the individual human being becomes more and
more subject to social constraint, and, as we have frequently
seen, the changes making for the tightening of the social fabric
may diminish the rights which the individual or large classes
of individuals can claim.... In this relation liberty and
order become opposed. But the opposition is not essential.
From the first the individual relies on social forces to maintain
him in his rights, and in the higher form of social organization
we have seen order and liberty drawing together again....
The best ordered community is that which gives most
scope to its component members to make the best of themselves,
while the 'best' in human nature is that which contributes
to the harmony and onward movement of society....
The responsible human being, man or woman, is the
center of modern ethics as of modern law, free so far as custom
and law are concerned to make his own life.... The
social nature of man is not diminished either on the side of
its needs or its duties by the fuller recognition of personal
rights. The difference is that, so far as rights and duties are
conceived as attaching to human beings as such, they become
universalized, <i>and are therefore the care of society as a
whole rather than of any partial group organization</i>."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p></div>

<p>With this statement may be compared the words of Green
and Alexander. According to Green, moral progress
consists in the <i>extension</i> of the area or range of persons
whose common good is concerned, and in the deepening
or <i>intensification</i> in the individual of his social interest:
"the settled disposition on each man's part to make the
most and best of humanity in his own person and in the
person of others."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Alexander's formul&aelig; for moral
growth are the "laws of differentiation and of comprehension."
The first means diversification, specialization,
differentiating the powers of an individual with
increased refinement of each. The law of comprehension
means the steady enlargement of the size and scope of
the social group (as from clan to modern national state)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
with its increased complexity of ways in which men are
brought into contact with one another.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p><b>Social Life Liberates and Directs Individual Energies.</b>&mdash;Breadth
in extent of community life goes hand in hand
with multiplication of the stimuli which call out an individual's
powers. Diversification of social activities increases
opportunities for his initiative and endeavor. Narrow
and meager social life means limitation of the scope
of activities in which its members may engage. It means
little occasion for the exercise of deliberation and choice,
without which character is both immature and fossilized;
it means, in short, restricted personality. But a rich and
varied society, one which liberates powers otherwise torpid
and latent, also exacts that they be employed in ways consistent
with its own interests. A society which is extensive
and complex would dissolve in anarchy and confusion were
not the activities of its various members upon the whole
mutually congruent. The world of action is a world of
which the individual is one limit, and humanity the other;
between them lie all sorts of associative arrangements of
lesser and larger scope, families, friendships, schools,
clubs, organizations for making or distributing goods, for
gathering and supplying commodities; activities politically
organized by parishes, wards, villages, cities, countries,
states, nations. Every maladjustment in relations among
these institutions and associated activities means loss and
friction in the relations between individuals; and thereby
introduces defect, division, and restriction into the various
powers which constitute an individual. All harmonious
co&ouml;peration among them means a fuller life and greater
freedom of thought and action for the individual person.</p>

<p>O<b>rder and Laws.</b>&mdash;The world of action as a scene of
organized activities going on in regular ways<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> thus pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>sents
a public or common order and authority, with its
established modes of operation, its laws. Organized institutions,
from the more permanent to the more casual,
with their orderly rules of conduct, are not, of course,
prior to individual activity; for their elements are individual
activities related in certain ways. But with respect
to <i>any one</i> individual in his separate or distributive capacity,
there is a genuine and important sense in which the
institution comes first. A child is born into an already
existing family with habits and beliefs already formed, not
indeed rigid beyond readaptation, but with their own
order (arrangements). He goes to schools which have
their established methods and aims; he gradually assumes
membership in business, civic, and political organizations,
with their own settled ways and purposes. Only in participating
in already fashioned systems of conduct does
he apprehend his own powers, appreciate their worth and
realize their possibilities, and achieve for himself a controlled
and orderly body of physical and mental habits.
He finds the value and the principles of his life, his satisfaction
and his norms of authority, in being a member of
associated groups of persons and in playing his part in
their maintenance and expansion.</p>

<p><b>The Social and the Moral.</b>&mdash;In customary society, it
does not occur to any one that there is a difference between
what he ought to do, i.e., the moral, and what those
about him customarily do, i.e., the social. The socially
established is the moral. Reflective morality brings with
it, as we have seen, a distinction. A thoughtfully minded
person reacts against certain institutions and habits which
obtain in his social environment; he regards certain ideas,
which he frames himself and which are not embodied in
social habits, as more moral than anything existing about
him. Such reactions against custom and such projections
of new ideas are necessary if there is to be progress in
society. But unfortunately it has often been forgotten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
that this distinctly <i>personal</i> morality, which takes its
stand against some established usage, and which, therefore,
for the time being has its abode only in the initiative
and effort of an individual, is simply the means of <i>social</i>
reconstruction. It is treated as if it were an end in itself,
and as if it were something higher than any morality which
is or can be socially embodied.</p>

<p>At some periods, this view has led to a monastic retreat
from all social affairs for the sake of cultivating personal
goodness. At other times, it has led to the political indifference
of the Cynic and Stoic. For ages, it led to
a morality of "other worldliness"; to the belief that true
goodness can be attained only in another kind of life and
world&mdash;a belief which carried with it relative contempt and
neglect of concrete social conditions in this life. Social
affairs at best were only "secular" and temporal, and,
in contrast with the eternal and spiritual salvation of the
individual's own soul, of little account. After the Renaissance
and the Protestant Revolt, this kind of moral
individualism persisted in different forms. Among the
hedonists, it took the form of assuming that while social
arrangements are of very great importance, their importance
lies in the fact that they hinder or help individuals
in the attainment of their own private pleasures.
The transcendentalists (such as Kant) asserted that, since
morality is wholly a matter of the inner motive, of the
personal attitude towards the moral law, social conditions
are wholly external. Good or evil lies wholly inside the
individual's own will. Social institutions may help or
hinder the outward <i>execution</i> of moral purpose; they may
be favorable or hostile to the successful outward display
of virtue. But they have nothing to do with originating
or developing the moral purpose, the Good Will, and hence,
in themselves, are lacking in moral significance. Thus
Kant made a sharp and fast distinction between <i>morality</i>,
appertaining solely to the individual's own inner conscious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>ness,
and <i>legality</i>, appertaining to the social and political
conditions of outward behavior. Social institutions and
laws may indeed regulate men's outer acts. So far as men
externally conform, their conduct is legal. But laws cannot
regulate or touch men's motives, which alone determine
the morality of their behavior.</p>

<p>We shall not repeat here our prior criticisms of hedonism
and utilitarianism in order to point out the falsity of this
division of moral action into unrelated inner (or private)
and outer (or social) factors. We may recall to memory,
however, that Kant himself virtually passed beyond his
own theory of moral individualism in insisting upon the
promotion of a "Kingdom of Ends," in which every person
is to be treated as an end in himself. We may recall
that the later utilitarians (such as Mill, Leslie Stephen,
Bain, and Spencer) insisted upon the <i>educative</i> value of
social institutions, upon their importance in forming certain
interests and habits in the individual. Thus social
arrangements were taken out of the category of mere
means to private good, and made the necessary factors
and conditions of the development of an individuality which
should have a reasonable and just conception of its own
nature and of its own good. We may also enumerate some
of the more fundamental ways in which social institutions
determine individual morality.</p>

<p>1. Apart from the social medium, the individual would
never "know himself"; he would never become acquainted
with his own needs and capacities. He would live the life
of a brute animal, satisfying as best he could his most
urgent appetites of hunger, thirst, and sex, but being, as
regards even that, handicapped in comparison with other
animals. And, as we have already seen, the wider and the
richer the social relationships into which an individual
enters, the more fully are his powers evoked, and the more
fully is he brought to recognize the possibilities latent in
them.  It is from seeing noble architecture and hearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
harmonious music that the individual learns to know to
what his own constructive and rhythmic tendencies, otherwise
blind and inchoate, may come. It is from achievement
in industrial, national, and family life that he is
initiated into perception of his own energy, loyalty, and
affection.</p>

<p>2. Social conditions not only evoke what is latent, and
bring to conscious recognition what is blind, but they
select, encourage, and confirm certain tendencies at the
expense of others. They enable the individual to discriminate
the better and the worse among his tendencies
and achievements. There is no limit in the power of
society to awaken and strengthen this habit of discrimination,
of choice after comparison, in its individual members.
A small social group with fixed habits, a clan, a
gang, a narrow sect, a dogmatic party, will restrict the
formation of critical powers&mdash;i.e., of conscientiousness or
moral thoughtfulness. But an individual who <i>really</i> becomes
a member of modern society, with its multiple occupations,
its easy intercourse, its free mobility, its rich
resources of art and science, will have only too many
opportunities for reflective judgment and personal valuation
and preference. <i>The very habits of individual moral
initiative, of personal criticism of the existent order, and
of private projection of a better order, to which moral
individualists point as proofs of the purely "inner" nature
of morality, are themselves effects of a variable and
complex social order.</i></p>

<p><b>The Moral Value of the State.</b>&mdash;If then we take modern
social life in its broadest extent, as including not only
what has become institutionalized and more or less fossilized,
but also what is still growing (forming and re-forming), we
may justly say that it is as true of progressive as of stationary
society, that the moral and the social are one.
The virtues of the individual in a progressive society are
more reflective, more critical, involve more exercise of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
comparison and selection, than in customary society. But
they are just as socially conditioned in their origin and
as socially directed in their manifestation.</p>

<p>In rudimentary societies, customs furnish the highest
ends of achievement; they supply the principles of social
organization and combination; and they form binding
laws whose breach is punished. The moral, political, and
legal are not differentiated. But village communities and
city-states, to say nothing of kingdoms and empires and
modern national States, have developed special organs
and special regulations for maintaining social unity and
public order. Small groups are usually firmly welded together
and are exclusive. They have a narrow but intense
social code:&mdash;like a patriarchal family, a gang, a social
set, they are clannish. But when a large number of such
groups come together within a more inclusive social unity,
some institution grows up to represent the interests and
activities of the whole as against the narrow and centrifugal
tendencies of the constituent factors. A society is then
<i>politically</i> organized; and a true public order with its
comprehensive laws is brought into existence. The moral
importance of the development of this public point of view,
with its extensive common purposes and with a general will
for maintaining them, can hardly be overestimated. Without
such organization, society and hence morality would
remain sectional, jealous, suspicious, unfraternal. Sentiments
of intense cohesion within would have been conjoined
with equally strong sentiments of indifference,
intolerance, and hostility to those without. In the wake of
the formation of States have followed more widely co-operative
activities, more comprehensive and hence more
reasonable principles of judgment and outlook. The individual
has been emancipated from his relative submergence
in the local and fixed group, and set upon his
own feet, with varied fields of activity open to him in which
to try his powers, and furnished with principles of judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>ing
conduct and projecting ideals which in theory,
at least, are as broad as the possibilities of humanity
itself.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. RESPONSIBILITY AND FREEDOM</h4>

<p>The more comprehensive and diversified the social order,
the greater the responsibility and the freedom of the individual.
His freedom is the greater, because the more numerous
are the effective stimuli to action, and the more varied
and the more certain the ways in which he may fulfill
his powers. His responsibility is greater because there
are more demands for considering the consequences of his
acts; and more agencies for bringing home to him the
recognition of consequences which affect not merely more
persons individually, but which also influence the more
remote and hidden social ties.</p>

<p><b>Liability.</b>&mdash;Freedom and responsibility have a relatively
superficial and negative meaning and a relatively positive
central meaning. In its external aspect, responsibility
is <i>liability</i>. An agent is free to act; yes, but&mdash;. He
must stand the consequences, the disagreeable as well as
the pleasant, the social as well as the physical. He may do
a given act, but if so, let him look out. His act is a matter
that concerns others as well as himself, and they will
prove their concern by calling him to account; and if he
cannot give a satisfactory and credible account of his
intention, subject him to correction. Each community and
organization informs its members what it regards as obnoxious,
and serves notice upon them that they have to
answer if they offend. The individual then is (1) likely
or liable to have to explain and justify his behavior, and
is (2) liable or open to suffering consequent upon inability
to make his explanation acceptable.</p>

<p><b>Positive Responsibility.</b>&mdash;In this way the individual is
made aware of the stake the community has in his behavior;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
and is afforded an opportunity to take that interest into
account in directing his desires and making his plans.
If he does so, he is a responsible person. The agent who
does not take to heart the concern which others show
that they have in his conduct, will note his liability only
as an evil to which he is exposed, and will take it into
consideration only to see how to escape or evade it. But
one whose point of view is sympathetic and reasonable will
recognize the justice of the community interest in his performances;
and will recognize the value to him of the
instruction contained in its assertions of its interest. Such
an one responds, answers, to the social demands made;
he is not merely called to answer. He holds himself responsible
for the consequences of his acts; he does not wait
to be held liable by others. When society looks for responsible
workmen, teachers, doctors, it does not mean
merely those whom it may call to account; it can do that
in any case. It wants men and women who habitually form
their purposes after consideration of the social consequences
of their execution. Dislike of disapprobation, fear
of penalty, play a part in generating this responsive
habit; but fear, operating directly, occasions only cunning
or servility. Fused, through reflection, with other
motives which prompt to action, it helps bring about that
apprehensiveness, or susceptibility to the rights of others,
which is the essence of responsibility, which in turn is the
sole <i>ultimate</i> guarantee of social order.</p>

<p><b>The Two Senses of Freedom.</b>&mdash;In its external aspect,
freedom is negative and formal. It signifies freedom <i>from</i>
subjection to the will and control of others; exemption
from bondage; release from servitude; capacity to act
without being exposed to direct obstructions or interferences
from others. It means a clear road, cleared of impediments,
for action. It contrasts with the limitations
of prisoner, slave, and serf, who have to carry out the will
of others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Effective Freedom.</b>&mdash;Exemption from restraint and
from interference with overt action is only a condition,
though an absolutely indispensable one, of effective freedom.
The latter requires (1) positive control of the resources
necessary to carry purposes into effect, possession
of the means to satisfy desires; and (2) mental equipment
with the trained powers of initiative and reflection requisite
for free preference and for circumspect and far-seeing desires.
The freedom of an agent who is merely released
from direct external obstructions is formal and empty.
If he is without resources of personal skill, without control
of the tools of achievement, he must inevitably lend
himself to carrying out the directions and ideas of others.
If he has not powers of deliberation and invention, he must
pick up his ideas casually and superficially from the suggestions
of his environment and appropriate the notions
which the interests of some class insinuate into his mind.
If he have not powers of intelligent self-control, he will
be in bondage to appetite, enslaved to routine, imprisoned
within the monotonous round of an imagery flowing from
illiberal interests, broken only by wild forays into the
illicit.</p>

<p><b>Legal and Moral.</b>&mdash;Positive responsibility and freedom
may be regarded as moral, while liability and exemption
are legal and political. A particular individual at a given
time is possessed of certain secured resources in execution
and certain formed habits of desire and reflection. In so
far, he is positively free. Legally, his sphere of activity
may be very much wider. The laws, the prevailing body
of rules which define existing institutions, would protect
him in exercising claims and powers far beyond those
which he can actually put forth. He is exempt from interference
in travel, in reading, in hearing music, in pursuing
scientific research. But if he has neither material means
nor mental cultivation to enjoy these legal possibilities,
mere exemption means little or nothing. It does, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
create a moral demand that the practical limitations which
hem him in should be removed; that practical conditions
should be afforded which will enable him effectively to
take advantage of the opportunities formally open. Similarly,
at any given time, the liabilities to which an individual
is actually held come far short of the accountability
to which the more conscientious members of society hold
themselves. The morale of the individual is in advance of
the formulated morality, or legality, of the community.</p>

<p><b>Relation of Legal to Moral.</b>&mdash;It is, however, absurd
to separate the legal and the ideal aspects of freedom
from one another. It is only as men are held liable that
they become responsible; even the conscientious man, however
much in some respects his demands upon himself
exceed those which would be enforced against him by
others, still needs in other respects to have his unconscious
partiality and presumption steadied by the requirements
of others. He needs to have his judgment balanced against
crankiness, narrowness, or fanaticism, by reference to the
sanity of the common standard of his times. It is only
as men are exempt from external obstruction that they
become aware of possibilities, and are awakened to demand
and strive to obtain more positive freedom. Or,
again, it is the possession by the more favored individuals
in society of an effectual freedom to do and to enjoy things
with respect to which the masses have only a formal and
legal freedom, that arouses a sense of inequity, and that
stirs the social judgment and will to such reforms of law,
of administration and economic conditions as will transform
the empty freedom of the less favored individuals
into constructive realities.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS</h4>

<p><b>The Individual and Social in Rights and Obligations.</b>&mdash;That
which, taken at large or in a lump, is called free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>dom
breaks up in detail into a number of specific, concrete
abilities to act in particular ways. These are termed
<i>rights</i>. Any right includes within itself in intimate unity
the individual and social aspects of activity upon which
we have been insisting. As a capacity for exercise of
power, it resides in and proceeds from some special agent,
some individual. As exemption from restraint, a secured
release from obstruction, it indicates at least the permission
and sufferance of society, a tacit social assent and
confirmation; while any more positive and energetic effort
on the part of the community to guarantee and safeguard
it, indicates an active acknowledgment on the part of
society that the free exercise by individuals of the power
in question is positively in its own interest. Thus a
right, individual in residence, is social in origin and intent.
The social factor in rights is made explicit in the demand
that the power in question be exercised in certain ways. A
right is never a claim to a wholesale, indefinite activity,
but to a <i>defined</i> activity; <i>to one carried on</i>, that is, <i>under
certain conditions</i>. This limitation constitutes the <i>obligatory</i>
phases of every right. The individual is free; yes,
that is his right. But he is free to act only according to
certain regular and established conditions. That is the
obligation imposed upon him. He has a right to use
public roads, but he is obliged to turn in a certain way.
He has a right to use his property, but he is obliged to
pay taxes, to pay debts, not to harm others in its use, and
so on.</p>

<p><b>Correspondence of Rights and Obligations.</b>&mdash;Rights
and obligations are thus strictly correlative. This is true
both in their external employment and in their intrinsic
natures. Externally the individual is under obligation to
use his right in a way which does not interfere with the
rights of others. He is free to drive on the public highways,
but not to exceed a certain speed, and on condition
that he turns to right or left as the public order requires.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
He is entitled to the land which he has bought, but this
possession is subject to conditions of public registration
and taxation. He may use his property, but not so that
it menaces others or becomes a nuisance. Absolute rights,
if we mean by absolute those not relative to any social
order and hence exempt from any social restriction, there
are none. But rights correspond even more intrinsically
to obligations. The right is itself a social outcome: it
is the individual's in so far as he is himself a social member
not merely physically, but in his habits of thought
and feeling. He is under obligation to use his rights in
social ways. The more we emphasize the free right of
an individual to his property, the more we emphasize what
society has done for him: the avenues it has opened to him
for acquiring; the safeguards it has put about him for
keeping; the wealth achieved by others which he may acquire
by exchanges themselves socially buttressed. So
far as an individual's own merits are concerned these
opportunities and protections are "unearned increments,"
no matter what credit he may deserve for initiative and
industry and foresight in using them. The only fundamental
anarchy is that which regards rights as private
monopolies, ignoring their social origin and intent.</p>

<p><b>Classes of Rights and Obligations.</b>&mdash;We may discuss
freedom and responsibility with respect to the social organization
which secures and enforces them; or from the
standpoint of the individual who exercises and acknowledges
them. From the latter standpoint, rights are conveniently
treated as physical and mental: not that the
physical and mental can be separated, but that emphasis
may fall primarily on control of the conditions required
to execute ideas and intentions, or upon the control of the
conditions involved in their personal formation and choice.
From the standpoint of the public order, rights and duties
are civil and political. We shall consider them in the next
chapter in connection with the organization of society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
in the State. Here we consider rights as inhering in an
individual in virtue of his membership in society.</p>

<p><b>I. Physical Rights.</b>&mdash;These are the rights to the free
unharmed possession of the body (the rights to life and
limb), exemption from homicidal attack, from assault and
battery, and from conditions that threaten health in more
obscure ways; and positively, the right to free movement
of the body, to use its members for any legitimate purpose,
and the right to unhindered locomotion. Without
the exemption, there is no security in life, no assurance;
only a life of constant fear and uncertainty, of loss of
limb, of injury from others, and of death. Without some
positive assurance, there is no chance of carrying ideas
into effect. Even if sound and healthy and extremely protected,
a man lives a slave or prisoner. Right to the
control and use of physical conditions of life takes effect
then in property rights, command of the natural tools and
materials which are requisite to the maintenance of the
body in a due state of health and to an effective and competent
use of the person's powers. These physical rights
to life, limb, and property are so basic to all achievement
and capability that they have frequently been termed
"natural rights." They are so fundamental to the existence
of personality that their insecurity or infringement
is a direct menace to the social welfare. The struggle
for human liberty and human responsibility has accordingly
been more acute at this than at any other point.
Roughly speaking, the history of personal liberty is the
history of the efforts which have safeguarded the security
of life and property and which have emancipated bodily
movement from subjection to the will of others.</p>

<p><b>Unsolved Problems: War and Punishment.</b>&mdash;While
history marks great advance, especially in the last four
or five centuries, as to the negative aspect of freedom or
release from direct and overt tyranny, much remains undone
on the positive side.  It is at this point of free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
physical control that all conflicts of rights concentrate
themselves. While the limitation by war of the right
to life may be cited as evidence for the fact that even this
right is not absolute but is socially conditioned, yet that
kind of correspondence between individual activity and social
well-being which exacts exposure to destruction as its
measure, is too suggestive of the tribal morality in which
the savage shows his social nature by participation in
a blood feud, to be satisfactory. Social organization is
clearly defective when its constituent portions are so
set at odds with one another as to demand from individuals
their death as their best service to the community. While
one may cite capital punishment to enforce, as if in large
type, the fact that the individual holds even his right to
life subject to the social welfare, the moral works the other
way to underline the failure of society to socialize its
members, and its tendency to put undesirable results out
of sight and mind rather than to face responsibility for
causes. The same limitation is seen in methods of imprisonment,
which, while supposed to be protective rather
than vindictive, recognize only in a few and sporadic cases
that the sole sure protection of society is through education
and correction of individual character, not by mere
physical isolation under harsh conditions.</p>

<p><b>Security of Life.</b>&mdash;In civilized countries the blood feud,
infanticide, putting to death the economically useless and
the aged, have been abolished. Legalized slavery, serfdom,
the subjection of the rights of wife and child to the will
of husband and father, have been done away with. But
many modern industries are conducted with more reference
to financial gain than to life, and the annual roll of
killed, injured, and diseased in factory and railway practically
equals the list of dead and wounded in a modern
war.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Most of these accidents are preventable. The will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>ingness
of parents on one side and of employers on the
other, conjoined with the indifference of the general public,
makes child-labor an effective substitute for exposure of
children and other methods of infanticide practiced by
savage tribes. Agitation for old-age pensions shows that
faithful service to society for a lifetime is still inadequate
to secure a prosperous old age.</p>

<p><b>Charity and Poverty.</b>&mdash;Society provides assistance and
remedial measures, poorhouses, asylums, hospitals. The
exceedingly poor are a public charge, supported by taxes
as well as by alms. Individuals are not supposed to die
from starvation nor to suffer without any relief or assistance
from physical defects and disease. So far, there is
growth in positive provision for the right to live. But the
very necessity for such extensive remedial measures shows
serious defects farther back. It raises the question of social
responsibility for the causes of such wholesale poverty
and widespread misery. Taken in conjunction with the
idleness and display of the congested rich, it raises the
question how far we are advanced beyond barbarism in
making organic provision for an effective, as distinct
from formal, right to life and movement. It is hard to
say whether the heavier indictment lies in the fact that
so many shirk their share of the necessary social labor
and toil, or in the fact that so many who are willing to
work are unable to do so, without meeting recurrent crises
of unemployment, and except under conditions of hours,
hygiene, compensation, and home conditions which reduce
to a low level the positive rights of life. The social order
protects the property of those who have it; but, although
historic conditions have put the control of the machinery
of production in the hands of a comparatively few per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>sons,
society takes little heed to see that great masses of
men get even that little property which is requisite to
secure assured, permanent, and properly stimulating conditions
of life. Until there is secured to and imposed upon
all members of society the right and the duty of work in
socially serviceable occupations, with due return in social
goods, rights to life and free movement will hardly advance
much beyond their present largely nominal state.</p>

<p><b>II. Rights to Mental Activity.</b>&mdash;These rights of course
are closely bound up with rights to physical well-being
and activity. The latter would have no meaning were it
not that they subserve purposes and affections; while the
life of mind is torpid or remote, dull or abstract, save as
it gets impact in physical conditions and directs them.
Those who hold that the limitations of physical conditions
have no <i>moral</i> signification, and that their improvement
brings at most an increase of more or less materialistic
comfort, not a moral advance, fail to note that the development
of concrete purposes and desires is dependent upon
so-called outward conditions. These conditions affect the
execution of purposes and wants; and this influence reacts
to determine the further arrest or growth of needs and
resolutions. The sharp and unjustifiable antithesis of
spiritual and material in the current conception of moral
action leads many well-intentioned people to be callous and
indifferent to the moral issues involved in physical and economic
progress. Long hours of excessive physical labor,
joined with unwholesome conditions of residence and work,
restrict the growth of mental activity, while idleness and
excess of physical possession and control pervert mind, as
surely as these causes modify the outer and overt acts.</p>

<p><b>Freedom of Thought and Affection.</b>&mdash;The fundamental
forms of the right to mental life are liberty of judgment
and sympathy. The struggle for spiritual liberty has been
as prolonged and arduous as that for physical freedom.
Distrust of intelligence and of love as factors in concrete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
individuals has been strong even in those who have proclaimed
most vigorously their devotion to them as abstract
principles. Disbelief in the integrity of mind, assertion
that the divine principles of thought and love are perverted
and corrupt in the individual, have kept spiritual authority
and prestige in the hands of the few, just as other
causes have made material possessions the monopoly of
a small class. The resulting restriction of knowledge and
of the tools of inquiry have kept the masses where their
blindness and dullness might be employed as further evidence
of their natural unfitness for personal illumination
by the light of truth and for free direction of the energy
of moral warmth.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Gradually, however, free speech, freedom
of communication and intercourse, of public assemblies,
liberty of the press and circulation of ideas, freedom
of religious and intellectual conviction (commonly called
freedom of conscience), of worship, and to some extent the
right to education, to spiritual nurture, have been achieved.
In the degree the individual has won these liberties, the
social order has obtained its chief safeguard against explosive
change and intermittent blind action and reaction,
and has got hold of the method of graduated and steady
reconstruction. Looked at as a mere expedient, liberty
of thought and expression is the most successful device
ever hit upon for reconciling tranquillity with progress,
so that peace is not sacrificed to reform nor improvement
to stagnant conservatism.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p><b>Right and Duty of Education.</b>&mdash;It is through education
in its broadest sense that the right of thought and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
sympathy become effective. The final value of all institutions
is their educational influence; they are measured
morally by the occasions they afford and the guidance
they supply for the exercise of foresight, judgment,
seriousness of consideration, and depth of regard. The
family, the school, the church, art, especially (to-day)
literature, nurture the affections and imagination, while
schools impart information and inculcate skill in various
forms of intellectual technique. In the last one hundred
years, the right of each individual to spiritual self-development
and self-possession, and the interest of society
as a whole in seeing that each of its members has an
opportunity for education, have been recognized in publicly
maintained schools with their ladder from kindergarten
through the college to the engineering and
professional school. Men and women have had put at
their disposal the materials and tools of judgment; have
had opened to them the wide avenues of science, history,
and art that lead into the larger world's culture. To some
extent negative exemption from arbitrary restriction
upon belief and thought has been developed into positive
capacities of intelligence and sentiment.</p>

<p><b>Restrictions from Inadequate Economic Conditions.</b>&mdash;Freedom
of thought in a developed constructive form is,
however, next to impossible for the masses of men so long
as their economic conditions are precarious, and their
main problem is to keep the wolf from their doors. Lack
of time, hardening of susceptibility, blind preoccupation
with the machinery of highly specialized industries, the
combined apathy and worry consequent upon a life maintained
just above the level of subsistence, are unfavorable
to intellectual and emotional culture. Intellectual cowardice,
due to apathy, laziness, and vague apprehension, takes
the place of despotism as a limitation upon freedom of
thought and speech. Uncertainty as to security of position,
the welfare of a dependent family, close men's mouths<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
from expressing their honest convictions, and blind their
minds to clear perception of evil conditions. The instrumentalities
of culture&mdash;churches, newspapers, universities,
theatres&mdash;themselves have economic necessities which tend
to make them dependent upon those who can best supply
their needs. The congestion of poverty on one side and
of "culture" on the other is so great that, in the words
of a distinguished economist, we are still questioning
"whether it is really impossible that all should start in
the world with a fair chance of leading a cultured life
free from the pains of poverty and the stagnating influences
of a life of excessive mechanical toil."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> We provide
free schools and pass compulsory education acts, but actively
and passively we encourage conditions which limit
the mass of children to the bare rudiments of spiritual
nurture.</p>

<p><b>Restriction of Educational Influences.</b>&mdash;Spiritual resources
are practically as much the possession of a special
class, in spite of educational advance, as are material
resources. This fact reacts upon the chief educative
agencies&mdash;science, art, and religion. Knowledge in its
ideas, language, and appeals is forced into corners; it is
overspecialized, technical, and esoteric because of its isolation.
Its lack of intimate connection with social practice
leads to an intense and elaborate over-training which
increases its own remoteness. Only when science and philosophy
are one with literature, the art of successful communication
and vivid intercourse, are they liberal in effect;
and this implies a society which is already intellectually
and emotionally nurtured and alive. Art itself, the embodiment
of ideas in forms which are socially contagious,
becomes what it is so largely, a development of technical
skill, and a badge of class differences. Religious emotion,
the quickening of ideas and affections by recognition of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
their inexhaustible signification, is segregated into special
cults, particular days, and peculiar exercises, and the
common life is left relatively hard and barren.</p>

<p>In short, the limitations upon freedom both of the physical
conditions and the mental values of life are at bottom
expressions of one and the same divorce of theory and
practice,&mdash;which makes theory remote, sterile, and technical,
while practice remains narrow, harsh, and also illiberal.
Yet there is more cause for hope in that so much has been
accomplished, than for despondency because mental power
and service are still so limited and undeveloped. The intermixture
and interaction of classes and nations are very
recent. Hence the opportunities for an effective circulation
of sympathetic ideas and of reasonable emotions have
only newly come into existence. Education as a public
interest and care, applicable to all individuals, is hardly
more than a century old; while a conception of the richness
and complexity of the ways in which it should
touch any one individual is hardly half a century old.
As society takes its educative functions more seriously and
comprehensively into account, there is every promise of
more rapid progress in the future than in the past. For
education is most effective when dealing with the immature,
those who have not yet acquired the hard and fixed directing
forms of adult life; while, in order to be effectively
employed, it must select and propagate that which is
common and hence typical in the social values that form
its resources, leaving the eccentric, the partial, and exclusive
gradually to dwindle. Upon some generous souls of
the eighteenth century there dawned the idea that the cause
of the indefinite improvement of humanity and the cause
of the little child are inseparably bound together.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XXI</small>

<br /><br />

CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE POLITICAL STATE</h2>


<p>We have been considering responsible freedom as it
centers in and affects individuals in their distinctive
capacities. It implies a public order which guarantees,
defines, and enforces rights and obligations. This public
order has a twofold relation to rights and duties: (1)
As the social counterpart of their exercise by individuals,
it constitutes <i>Civil Society</i>. It represents those forms of
associated life which are orderly and authorized, because
constituted by individuals in the exercise of their rights,
together with those special forms which protect and insure
them. Families, clubs, guilds, unions, corporations come
under the first head; courts and civil administrative bodies,
like public railway and insurance commissions, etc., come
under the second. (2) The public order also fixes the
fundamental terms and conditions on which at any given
time rights are exercised and remedies secured; it is organized
for the purpose of defining the basic methods of
exercising the activities of its constituent elements, individual
and corporate. In this aspect it is the <i>State</i>.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. CIVIL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS</h4>

<p>Every act brings the agent who performs it into association
with others, whether he so intends or not. His act
takes effect in an organized world of action; in social
arrangement and institutions. So far as such combinations
of individuals are recurrent or stable, their nature
and operations are definitely formulated and definitely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
enforceable. Partnerships, clubs, corporations, guilds,
families are such stable unions, with their definite spheres
of action. Buying and selling, teaching and learning, producing
and consuming, are recurrent activities whose legitimate
methods get prescribed. These specific provinces and
methods of action are defined in Civil Rights. They express
the guaranteed and regular ways in which an individual,
through action, voluntarily enters into association or combination
with others for the sake of a common end. They
differ from political rights and obligations in that the latter
concern modes of social organization which are so fundamental
that they are not left to the voluntary choice and purpose
of an individual. As a social being, he must have political
relationships, must be subject to law, pay taxes, etc.</p>

<p><b>1. Contract Rights.</b>&mdash;Modes of association are so numerous
and variable that we can only select those aspects
of civil rights which are morally most significant. We
shall discriminate them according as they have to do (1)
with the more temporary and casual combinations of individuals,
for limited and explicit purposes; and (2) with
more permanent, inclusive, and hence less definable ends;
and (3) with the special institutions which exist for guaranteeing
individuals the enjoyment of their rights and
providing remedies if these are infringed upon. (1)
Contract rights. Rights of the first type are rights resulting
from express or implied agreements of certain
agents to do or refrain from doing specific acts, involving
exchange of services or goods to the mutual benefit of both
parties in the transaction. Every bargain entered into,
every loaf of bread one buys or paper of pins one sells,
involves an implied and explicit contract. A genuinely
free agreement or contract means (i.) that each party
to the transaction secures the benefit he wants; (ii.)
that the two parties are brought into co&ouml;perative or
mutually helpful relations; and that (iii.) the vast, vague,
complex business of conducting social life is broken up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
into a multitude of specific acts to be performed and of
specific goods to be delivered, at definite times and definite
places. Hence it is hardly surprising that one school of
social moralists has found in the conception of free contract
its social ideal. Every individual concerned assumes
obligations which it is to his interest to perform so that
the performance is voluntary, not coerced; while, at the
same time, some other person is engaged to serve him in
some way. The limitations of the contract idea will concern
us later.</p>

<p><b>2. The Permanent Voluntary Associations.</b>&mdash;Partnerships,
limited liability corporations, guilds, trades
unions, churches, schools, clubs, are more permanent and
comprehensive associations, involving more far-reaching
rights and obligations. Societies organized for conversation
and sociability or conviviality, "corporations not for
profit," but for mutual enjoyment or for benevolent ends,
come under the same head. Most significant are the associations
which, while entered only voluntarily and having
therefore a basis in contract, are for generic ends. Thus
they are permanent, and cover much more than can be
written in the contract. Marriage, in modern society, is
entered into by contract; but married life is not narrowed
to the exchange of specific services at specific times. It is
a union for mutual economic and spiritual goods which
are coextensive with all the interests of the parties. In
its connection with the generation and rearing of children,
it is a fundamental means of guarding all social
interests and of directing their progress. Schools, colleges,
churches, federations of labor, organizations of
employers, and of both together, represent other forms of
permanent voluntary organizations which may have the
most far-reaching influence both upon those directly concerned
and upon society at large.</p>

<p><b>3. Right to Use of Courts.</b>&mdash;All civil rights get their
final application and test in the right to have conflicting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
rights defined and infringed rights remedied by appeal
to a public authority having general and final jurisdiction.
"The right to sue and be sued" may seem too legal
and external a matter to be worthy of much note in an
ethical treatise; but it represents the culmination of an
age-long experimentation with the problem of reconciling
individual freedom and public order. No civil right is
effective unless it carries with it a statement of a method
of enforcement and, if necessary, of redress and remedy.
Otherwise it is a mere name. Moreover, conflicts of civil
rights are bound to occur even when there is good faith
on the part of all concerned, just because new situations
arise. Unless there is a way of defining the respective
rights of each party in the new situation, each will arbitrarily
and yet in good faith insist upon asserting his
rights on the old basis: private war results. A new order
is not achieved and the one already attained is threatened
or disrupted. The value of rights to the use of courts
resides, then, to a comparatively small degree, in the specific
cases of deliberate wrong which are settled. What is more
important is that men get instruction as to the proper scope
and limits of their activities, through the provision of an
effective mechanism for amicable settlement of disputes
in those cases in which rights are vague and ambiguous
because the situations are novel.</p>

<p><b>Classes of Wrongs and Remedies.</b>&mdash;Infringements
upon rights, such as murder, theft, arson, forgery, imply
a character which is distinctly anti-social in its bent. The
wrong, although done to one, is an expression of a disposition
which is dangerous to all. Such a wrong is a crime;
it is a matter for the direct jurisdiction of public authority.
It is the business of all to co&ouml;perate in giving evidence,
and it may render one a criminal accomplice to
conceal or suppress evidence, just as it is "compounding
a felony" for the wronged individual to settle the wrong
done him by arranging privately for compensation. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
penalty in such cases is generally personal; imprisonment
or at least a heavy fine. The violation may, however, be
of the nature of a wrong or "tort," rather than of a crime;
it may indicate a disposition indifferent to social interests
or neglectful of them rather than one actively hostile to
them. Such acts as libels, trespasses upon the land of
another, are illustrations. In such cases, the machinery of
justice is put in motion by the injured individual, not
by the commonwealth. This does not mean that society
as a whole has no interest in the matter; but that under
certain circumstances encouraging individuals to look out
for their own rights and wrongs is socially more important
than getting certain wrongs remedied irrespective of
whether men stand up for their own rights or not. Then
again, there are civil disputes which indicate neither a
criminal nor a harmful disposition, but rather uncertainty
as to what the law really is, leading to disputes
about rights&mdash;interpretations of a contract, express or
implied. Here the interest of society is to provide a
method of settlement which will hinder the growth of ill
will and private retaliation; and which also will provide
precedents and principles that will lessen uncertainty and
conflict in like cases in the future.</p>

<p>Peace and tranquillity are not merely the absence of
open friction and disorder. They mean specific, easily-known,
and generally recognized principles which determine
the province and limits of the legitimate activity
of every person. Publicity, standards, rules of procedure,
remedies acknowledged in common, are their essence. <i>Res
publica</i>, the common concern, remains vague and latent
till defined by impartial, disinterested social organs. Then
it is expressed in regular and guaranteed modes of activity.
In the pregnant phrase of Aristotle, the administration
of justice is also its determination: that is, its
discovery and promulgation.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span></p>

<h4>&sect; 2. DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS</h4>

<p><b>Contrast of Primitive with Present Justice.</b>&mdash;The significance
of the accomplishments and the defects of the
present administration of law may be brought out by a
sketch of its contrast with primitive methods. In savage
and barbarian society, on account of the solidarity of the
kin-group, any member of the group is likely to be attacked
for the offense of any other (see p. 28). He may
not have participated in the act, or have had complicity
in planning it. His guilt is that the same blood runs
in his veins.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The punitive attack, moreover, is made
directly and promiscuously by the injured man and by
his blood-relatives; it is made in the heat of passion or in
the vengeance of stealth as custom may decree. Says
Hearn, the state "did not interfere in the private quarrels
of its citizens. Every man took care of his own
property and his own household, and every hand guarded
its own head. If any injury were done to any person,
he retaliated, or made reprisals, or otherwise sought
redress, as custom prescribed."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The reprisal may itself
have called for another, and the blood-feud was on. In
any case, the state of affairs was one literally, not metaphorically,
described as "private war."</p>

<p><b>Changes Now Effected.</b>&mdash;This state of affairs has been
superseded by one in which a third, a public and impartial
authority (1) takes cognizance of offenses against another
individual as offenses against the commonwealth;
(2) apprehends the supposed offender; (3) determines
and applies an objective standard of judgment, the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
for all, the law; (4) tries the supposed offender according
to rules of procedure, including rules of evidence or
proof, which are also publicly promulgated; and (5)
takes upon itself the punishment of the offender, if found
guilty. The history of this change, important and interesting
as it is, does not belong here. We are concerned
here only with the relation of public authority, public
law, and public activity to the development of the freedom
of the individual on one side and of his responsibility
on the other.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> We shall point out in a number of particulars
that the evolution of freedom and responsibility in
individuals has coincided with the evolution of a public
and impartial authority.</p>

<p><b>1. Good and Evil as Quasi-Physical.</b>&mdash;There are two
alternatives in the judgment of good and evil. (1) They
may be regarded as having <i>moral</i> significance, that is,
as having a voluntary basis and origin. (2) Or they may
be considered as substantial properties of things, as a sort
of essence diffused through them, or as a kind of force
resident in them, in virtue of which persons and things are
noxious or helpful, malevolent or kindly. Savage tribes,
for instance, cannot conceive either sickness or death as
natural evils; they are attributed to the malicious magic
of an enemy. Similarly the evil which follows from the
acts of a man is treated as a sign of some metaphysical
tendency inherent in him. Some men bring bad luck upon
everything and everybody they have anything to do with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
A curse is on their doings. No distinction is made between
such evils and those which flow from intention and
character. The notion of the moral or voluntary nature
of good and evil hardly obtains. The quasi-physical view,
bordering upon the magical, prevails. The result is that
evil is thought of as a contagious matter, transmitted from
generation to generation, from class or person to class or
person; and as something to be got rid of, if at all, by
devices which are equally physical. Natural evils, plagues,
defeats, earthquakes, etc., <i>are treated as quasi-moral, while
moral evils are treated as more than half physical</i>.
Sins are infectious diseases, and natural diseases are
malicious interferences of a human or divine enemy.
Morals are materialized, and nature is moralized or
demoralized.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Now it is hardly necessary to point out the effect of
such conceptions in restricting the freedom and responsibility
of the individual person. Man is hemmed in as to
thought and action on all sides by all kinds of mysterious
forces working in unforeseeable ways. This is true
enough in his best estate. When to this limitation is added
a direction of energy into magical channels, away from
those controllable sources of evil which reside in human disposition,
the amount of effective freedom possible is slight.
This same misplacing of liability holds men accountable
for acts they have not committed, because some magic
tendency for evil is imputed to them. Famine, pestilence,
defeat in war are evils to be remedied by sacrifice of goods
or persons or by ritualistic ceremonies; while the reme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>diable
causes of harm in human ignorance and negligence
go without attention.</p>

<p><b>2. Accident and Intention.</b>&mdash;Under such circumstances,
little distinction can be made between the good and evil
which an individual <i>meant</i> to do and that which he <i>happened</i>
to do. The working presumption of society, up to
a comparatively late stage of its history, was that every
harmful consequence is an evidence of evil disposition
in those who were in any way concerned. This limitation
of freedom was accompanied by a counterpart limitation
of responsibility. Where no harm actually resulted, there
was thought to be no harmful intent. Animals and even
inanimate objects which do injury are baleful things and
come under disapprobation and penalty. Even in civilized
Athens there was a survival of the practice of holding
inanimate things liable. If a tree fell on a man and killed
him, the tree was to be brought to trial, and after condemnation
cast beyond the civic borders, i.e., outlawed.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Anyhow, the owner of an offending article was almost
always penalized. Westermarck,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> with reference to the
guilt of animals, cites an instance, dated in 1457, "when
a sow and her six young ones were tried on a charge of
their having murdered and partly eaten a child; the sow,
being found guilty, was condemned to death, the young
pigs were acquitted on account of their youth and the
bad example of their mother." When sticks, stones, and
animals are held accountable for evil results, there is little
chance of discriminating intent and accident or misadventure
in the case of personal agents. "The devil himself
knoweth not the intent, the 'thought' of man" was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
the medi&aelig;val maxim; all that can be certain is that harm
has come and the one who caused it must suffer; or else
no overt harm has come and no one is to blame.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Harm
has been done and any one concerned, even remotely, in
the injurious situation, is <i>ex officio</i> guilty; it will not do
to take chances. The remoteness of an implication which
may involve liability is seen in the condition of English
law in the thirteenth century: "At your request I accompany
you when you are about your own affairs: my
enemies fall upon and kill me: you must pay for my death.
You take me to see a wild-beast show, or that interesting
spectacle a madman: beast or madman kills me; you must
pay. You hang up your sword; some one else knocks it
down so that it cuts me; you must pay."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Only gradually
did intent clearly evolve as the central element in an act,
and thus lead to the idea of a voluntary or free act.</p>

<p>That the limitation upon the side of responsibility was
equally great is obvious. If a man is held liable for what
he did not and could not foresee or desire, there is no
ground for his <i>holding himself</i> responsible for anticipating
the consequences of his acts, and forming his
plans according as he foresees. This comes out clearly
in the obverse of what has just been said. If no harm
results from a willful attempt to do evil, the individual is
not blamed. He goes scot free. "An attempt to commit
a crime is no crime."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p><b>3. Character and Circumstances.</b>&mdash;Even in law, to say
nothing of personal moral judgments, we now almost as a
matter of course take into account, in judging an agent's
intent, both circumstances, and character as inferred from
past behavior. We extend our view of consequences, tak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>ing
into account in judging the moral quality of a particular
deed, consequences its doer is <i>habitually</i> found to
effect. We blame the individual less for a deed if we find it
contrary to his habitual course. We blame him more, if we
find he has a character given to that sort of thing. We
take into account, in short, the permanent attitude and
disposition of the agent. We also discriminate the conditions
and consequences of a deed much more carefully.
Self-defense, protection of others or of property, come
in as "extenuating circumstances"; the degree of provocation,
the presence of immediate impulsive fear or anger,
as distinct from a definitely formed, long-cherished idea,
are considered. The questions of first or of repeated
offense, of prior criminality or good behavior, enter
in. Questions of heredity, of early environment, of early
education and opportunity are being brought to-day into
account.</p>

<p>We are still very backward in this respect, both in personal
and in public morals; in private judgment and in
legal procedure and penalty. Only recently have we, for
example, begun to treat juvenile delinquents in special
ways; and the effort to carry appropriate methods further
meets with strong opposition and the even stronger inertia
of indifference. It is regarded by many good
people as lowering the bars of responsibility to consider
early training and opportunity, just as in its day it was
so regarded to plead absence of intent in cases where evil
had actually resulted. It is not "safe" to let any one
off from the rigor of the law. The serious barrier, now
as earlier, is upon the scientific or intellectual side. There
was a time when it did not seem feasible to pass upon
intent; it was hidden, known only to God. But we have
now devised ways, adequate in principle, though faulty
in detail, to judge immediate intent; similarly, with the
growth of anthropology, psychology, statistics, and the
resources of publicity in social science, we shall in time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
find it possible to consider the effects of heredity, early
environment, and training upon character and so upon
intent. We shall then regard present methods of judging
intent to be almost as barbarous as we now consider the
earlier disregard of accident and provocation. Above
all we shall learn that increased, not relaxed responsibility,
comes with every increase of discrimination of causes lying
in character and conditions.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p><b>4. Intellectual Incapacity and Thoughtlessness.</b>&mdash;With
increasing recognition of character as the crucial element
in voluntary action, we now take into account such matters
as age, idiocy, and insanity as factors of judgment. But
this also has been a slow growth. If we take the one
question of insanity, for example, in 1724 exculpation for
harm resulting from a madman's acts required that the
person excused "be a man that is totally deprived of
his understanding and memory, and doth not know what
he is doing, no more than an infant, than a brute, or a
wild beast." At the beginning of the nineteenth century,
the excuse was no longer that of being such a raving
lunatic as is here implied; but of knowing right and wrong
from each other <i>in the abstract</i>. By a celebrated case in
1843, the rule was changed, in English law, to knowledge
of the difference between right and wrong in the
particular case. Further advance waits upon progress
of science which will make it more possible to judge the
specific mental condition of the person acting; and thus
do away with the abuses of the present system which tend,
on the one hand, to encourage the pleading of insanity where
none may exist; and, on the other hand (by a rigid application
of a technical rule), to condemn persons really irre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>sponsible.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Popular judgment still inclines to impute clear
and definite intention on the basis of results; and to ignore
conditions of intellectual confusion and bewilderment, and
justifies itself in its course on the ground that such is the
only "safe" course.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p><b>Responsibility for Thoughtlessness.</b>&mdash;But the release
from responsibility for deeds in which the doer is intellectually
incapacitated, is met on the other side by holding
individuals of normal mental constitution responsible for
some consequences which were not thought of at all. We
even hold men accountable for <i>not</i> thinking to do certain
acts. The former are acts of heedlessness or carelessness,
as when a mason on top of a building throws rubbish on
to a street below which injures some one, without any
thought on his part of this result, much less any deliberate
desire to effect it. The latter are acts of negligence, as
when, say, an engineer fails to note a certain signal. In
such cases even when no harm results, we now hold the
agent morally culpable. Similarly we blame children for
<i>not</i> thinking of the consequences of their acts; we blame
them for <i>not</i> thinking to do certain things at a certain
time&mdash;to come home when told, and so on. This is not
merely a matter of judgment by others. The more conscientious
a person is, the more occasions he finds to judge
<i>himself</i> with respect to results which <i>happened because he
did not think or deliberate or foresee at all</i>&mdash;provided he
has reason to believe he would have thought of the harmful
results if he had been of a different character. Because
we were absorbed in something else we did not think, and
while, in the abstract, this something else may have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
all right, in the concrete it may be proof of an unworthy
character. The very fact that we permitted ourselves to
become so absorbed that the thought of an engagement,
or of an opportunity to help some friend whom we knew
to be in need, did not occur to us, is evidence of a selfish,
i.e., inconsiderate, character.</p>

<p>The case seems paradoxical and is crucial. Others
hold us responsible because we <i>were</i> irresponsible in action
and <i>in order</i> that we may <i>become</i> responsible. We
blame ourselves precisely because we discover that an
unconscious preference for a private or exclusive good
led us to be careless of the good of others. The effect
(if the regret is genuine, not simulated) is to develop
a habit of greater thoughtfulness in the future. Less and
less do men accept for others or for themselves ignorance
as an excuse for bad consequences, when the ignorance
itself flows from character. Our chief moral business
is to become acquainted with consequences. Our moral
character surely does not depend in this case, then, upon
the fact that we had alternatives clearly in mind and chose
the worse; the difficulty is that we had only one alternative
in mind and did not <i>consciously</i> choose at all. Our
freedom lies in the <i>capacity</i> to alter our mode of action,
through having our ignorance enlightened by being held
for the neglected consequences when brought to accountability
by others, or by holding ourselves accountable in subsequent
reflection. Cases of careless acts and of acts
omitted through negligence are thus crucial for any theory
of freedom and responsibility. Either we are all wrong in
blaming ourselves or others in such cases, because there is
no free or voluntary element in them; or else there is
responsibility when deliberate comparison of alternatives
and conscious preference are absent. There is responsibility
for the absence of deliberation. Nature does not
forbear to attach consequences to acts because of the
ignorance of the one who does the deed. The evil results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
that follow in the wake of a thoughtless act are precisely
the reminders that make one take thought the next time.
Similarly, to be held liable by others or to take ourselves to
task for forgetfulness, inconsiderateness, and negligence,
is the way in which to build up conscientious foresight and
deliberate choice. The increased complexity and danger
of modern industrial activity, the menace of electric power,
of high explosives, of railway trains and trolley cars, of
powerful machines, have done much to quicken recognition
that negligence may be criminal, and to reawaken
the conviction of Greek thought that thoughtless ignorance,
where knowledge is possible, is the worst of evils.
The increased interdependence of men, through travel
and transportation, collective methods of production, and
crowding of population in cities, has widened the area
of the harm likely to result from inconsiderate action, and
has strengthened the belief that adequate thoughtfulness is
possible only where there is sympathetic interest in others.</p>

<p><b>5. The Conflict of Form and Substance.</b>&mdash;The technical
forms of procedure concerned in establishing and remedying
rights were, for long ages, more important than
the substantial ends by which alone the forms may be
justified. Any effort for a remedy was nullified if the
minuti&aelig; of complicated formul&aelig; (largely magical or ritualistic
in their origin) were deviated from. Almost any
obligation might be escaped by some quirk or turn in some
slight phrase or motion, without which no agreement was
binding, so sacramental was the importance of the very
words. In early days the rigidity of these semi-ritualistic
performances doubtless served to check arbitrary and
reckless acts, and to impress the sense of the value of a
standard.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> But they survived as "rudimentary organs"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
long after they had done their work in this respect; and
after they had been eliminated from legal procedure they
survived as habits of judging conduct.</p>

<p><b>Survivals of Spirit of Individualistic Litigation.</b>&mdash;The
fact that the procedure of justice originated as methods
of supplying impartial umpires for conflicts waged between
individuals, has had serious consequences. It has
had indeed the desirable consequence of quickening men
to the perception of their rights and to their obligation as
social members to maintain them intact. But it has also
had the undesirable result of limiting the function of the
public interest to the somewhat negative one of securing
fair play between contentious individuals. The battle is
not now fought out with fists or spears or oaths or ordeals:
but it is largely a battle of wits and of technical resources
between the opposite parties and their lawyers, with the
State acting the part of a benevolently neutral umpire.
The ignorant, the poor, the foreign, and the <i>merely</i>
honest are almost inevitably at a discount in this battle.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
And, in any case, the technical aspect of justice, that is,
the question of proper forms gets out of true perspective.
The "legally-minded" man is likely to be one with whom
technical precedents and rules are more important than
the goods to be achieved and the evils to be avoided. With
increase of publicity and scientific methods of determining
and interpreting facts, and with a public and professional
criticism which is impartial and wise, we may anticipate
that the supremacy of the general good will be increasingly
recognized in cases of litigation, and that the courts,
as organs of public justice, will take a more active and substantial
part in the management of all legal controversies.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Legal and Moral.</b>&mdash;But, at the best, definitions of rights
and of remedial procedures only (1) lay down general, not
individual conditions, and (2), so far as they are strict,
register precedent and custom rather than anticipate the
novel and variable. They can state what shall not be
done. Except in special cases, they cannot state what
shall be done, much less the spirit and disposition in which
it shall be done. In their formulations, they present a sort
of minimum limit of morality not to be overstepped by
those inclined to ill. They throw little light on the positive
capacities and responsibilities of those who are socially
minded. They have a moral purpose: they free energy
from the friction attendant upon vague, obscure, and
uncertain situations, by enlightening men as to what they
may do and how they may do it. But the exaggeration
of form at the expense of the substantial end and good,
leads to misplaced emphasis and false perspective. The
rules are treated as ends; they are employed not to get
insight into consequences, but as justifying, apart from
consequences, certain acts. The would-be conscientious
agent is led into considering goodness as a matter of obeying
rules, not of fulfilling ends. The average individual
conceives he has satisfied the requirements of morality when
he has conformed to the average level of legal definition
and prescription. Egoistic, self-seeking men regard their
actions as sanctioned if they have <i>not</i> broken the laws; and
decide this question by success in evading penalties. The
intelligence that should go to employing the spirit of laws
to enlighten behavior is spent in ingenious inventions for
observing their letter. The "respectable" citizen of this
type is one of the unsocialized forces that social reformers
find among their most serious obstacles.</p>

<p>This identification of morality with the legal and jural
leads to a reaction which is equally injurious: the complete
separation of the legal and the moral, the former
conceived as merely "outer," concerned entirely with acts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
not at all with motive and character. The effect of this
divorce is perhaps more serious upon the moral than upon
the legal. The separation makes morals sentimental and
whimsical, or else transcendental and esoteric. It leads
to neglect of the social and institutional realities which
form a world of action as surely as natural objects and
energies form a physical world, and ends in the popular
conception of morals as just a matter of "goodness"
(the goody-goodiness) of individuals. One of the most
fundamental of moral duties is that of making the legal
order a more adequate expression of the common good.</p>

<p><b>Special Problems.</b>&mdash;Civil Society thus imposes upon its
members not only specific obligations, but it also imposes
upon all who enjoy its benefits the supreme obligation of
seeing that the civic order is itself intelligently just in
its methods of procedure. The peculiar moral problems
which men have to face as members of civil society change,
of course, from time to time with change of conditions;
among the more urgent of present problems, we may
mention:</p>

<p><b>1. Reform of Criminal Procedure.</b>&mdash;The negative side
of morality is never so important as the positive, because
the pathological cannot be as important as the physiological
of which it is a disturbance and perversion. But
no fair survey of our methods, either of locating criminality
or of punishing it, can fail to note that they contain far
too many survivals of barbarism. Compared with primitive
times we have indeed won a precious conquest. Even as
late as 1813, a proposal to change the penalty for stealing
five shillings from death to transportation to a remote
colony, was defeated in England.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> But we are likely in
flattering ourselves upon the progress made to overlook
that which it remains to make. Our trials are technical
rather than human: they assume that just about so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
persistent criminality must persist in any case. They
endeavor, in rather routine and perfunctory ways, to label
this and that person as criminal in such and such degrees,
or, by technical devices and resources, to acquit. In many
American states, distrust of government, inherited from
days of tyrannical monarchy or oligarchy, protects the
accused in all sorts of ways. For fear the government
will unjustly infringe upon the liberty of the individual,
the latter is not only&mdash;as is just&mdash;regarded as innocent till
proved guilty; but is provided with every possible technical
advantage in rules of evidence, postponements and appeals,
advantages backed up, in many cities, by association
with political bosses which gives him a corrupt "pull."</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is as yet no general recognition
of the possibility of an unbiased scientific investigation
into all the antecedents (hereditary and environmental) of
evildoers; an investigation which would connect the wrong
done with the <i>character of the individual</i> committing it, and
not merely with one of a number of technical degrees of
crime, laid down in the statute books in the abstract, without
reference to particular characters and circumstances.
Thus while the evildoer has in one direction altogether
too much of a chance to evade justice, he has in another
direction a chance at only technical, rather than at moral,
justice&mdash;justice as an individual human being. It is not
possible to discuss here various methods which have been
proposed for remedying these defects. But it is clearly
the business of the more thoughtful members of society
to consider the evils seriously and to interest themselves
actively in their reform. We need, above all, a change in
two respects: (a) recognition of the possibilities of new
methods of judgment which the sciences of physiology,
psychology, and sociology have brought about; and (b)
surrender of that feudal conception according to which
men are divided, as it were essentially, into two classes:
one the criminal and the other the meritorious. We need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
to consider the ways in which the pressure and the opportunities
of environment and education, of poverty and comfortable
living, of extraneous suggestion and stimulation,
make the differences between one man and another; and
to recognize how fundamentally one human nature is at
bottom. Juvenile courts, probation officers, detention
officers, mark the beginnings of what is possible, but only
the beginnings. For the most part crime is still treated
sordidly and by routine, except when, being sensational,
it is the occasion for a great battle of wits between keen
prosecuting attorney and clever "criminal lawyer," with
the world through the newspapers watching the display.</p>

<p><b>2. Reform of Punishment.</b>&mdash;Emerson's bitter words are
still too applicable. "Our distrust is very expensive. The
money we spend for courts and prisons is very ill laid out.
We make, by distrust, the thief and burglar and incendiary,
and by our court and jail we keep him so."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Reformatories,
whose purpose is change of disposition, not
mere penalization, have been founded; but there are still
many more prisons than reformatories. And, if it be
argued that most criminals are so hardened in evil-doing
that reformatories are of no use, the answer is twofold.
We do not know, because we have never systematically
and intelligently tried to find out; and, even if it were so,
nothing is more illogical than to turn the unreformed criminal,
at the end of a certain number of months or years,
loose to prey again upon society. Either reform or else
permanent segregation is the logical alternative. Indeterminate
sentences, release on probation, discrimination of
classes of offenders, separation of the first and more or
less accidental and immature offender from the old and
experienced hand, special matrons for women offenders,
introduction of education and industrial training into penitentiaries,
the finding of employment for those released<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>&mdash;all
mark improvements. They are, however, as yet inchoate.
Intelligent members of society need to recognize
their own responsibility for the promotion of such reforms
and for the discovery of new ones.</p>

<p><b>3. Increase of Administrative Efficiency.</b>&mdash;In the last
one hundred years, society has rapidly grown in internal
complexity. Commercial changes have brought about
an intense concentration of population in cities; have
promoted migratory travel and intercourse, with destruction
of local ties; have developed world markets and collective
but impersonal (corporate) production and distribution.
Many new problems have been created, while at
the same time many of the old agencies for maintaining
order have been weakened or destroyed, especially such
as were adapted to small groups with fixed habits. A
great strain has thus been put upon the instrumentalities
of justice. Pioneer conditions retarded in America the
development of the problems incident upon industrial
reconstruction. The possibility of moving on, of taking
up new land, finding unutilized resources of forest and
mine, the development of new professions, the growth of
population with new needs to be met, stimulated and rewarded
individual enterprise. Under such circumstances
there could be no general demand for public agencies of
inspection, supervision, and publicity. But the pioneer
days of America are practically ended. American cities
and states find themselves confronted with the same problems
of public health, poverty and unemployment, congested
population, traffic and transportation, charitable
relief, tramps and vagabondage, and so forth, that have
troubled older countries.</p>

<p>We face these problems, moreover, with traditions which
are averse to "bureaucratic" administration and public
"interference." Public regulation is regarded as a
"paternalistic" survival, quite unsuited to a free and
independent people. It would be foolish, indeed, to over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>look
or deny the great gains that have come from our
American individualistic convictions: the quickening of
private generosity, the growth of a generalized sense of
<i>noblesse oblige</i>&mdash;of what every successful individual owes
to his community; of personal initiative, self-reliance,
and versatile "faculty"; of interest in all the voluntary
agencies which by education and otherwise develop the
individuality of every one; and of a demand for equality of
opportunity, a fair chance, and a square deal for all. But
it is certain that the country has reached a state of
development, in which these individual achievements and possibilities
require new civic and political agencies if they
are to be maintained as realities. Individualism means
inequity, harshness, and retrogression to barbarism (no
matter under what veneer of display and luxury), unless
it is a <i>generalized</i> individualism: an individualism which
takes into account the real good and effective&mdash;not merely
formal&mdash;freedom of <i>every</i> social member.</p>

<p>Hence the demand for civic organs&mdash;city, state,
and federal,&mdash;of expert inquiry, inspection, and supervision
with respect to a large number of interests
which are too widespread and too intricate to be well
cared for by private or voluntary initiative. The
well-to-do in great cities may segregate themselves in
the more healthful quarters; they may rely upon their
automobiles for local transportation; they may secure pure
milk and unadulterated foods from personal resources;
they may, by their combined "pull," secure good schools,
policing, lighting, and well-paved streets for their own
localities. But the great masses are dependent upon public
agencies for proper air, light, sanitary conditions of
work and residence, cheap and effective transportation,
pure food, decent educative and recreative facilities in
schools, libraries, museums, parks.</p>

<p>The problems which fall to the lot of the proper organs
of administrative inspection and supervision are essentially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
<i>scientific</i> problems, questions for expert intelligence conjoined
with wide sympathy. In the true sense of the word
political, they are political questions: that is, they relate
to the welfare of society as an organized community of
attainment and endeavor. In the cant sense of the term
political, the sense of conventional party-issues and party-lines,
they have no more to do with politics than have the
multiplication table and the laws of hygiene. Yet they
are at present almost hopelessly entangled with irrelevant
"political" issues, and are almost hopelessly under the
heel of party-politicians whose least knowledge is of the
scientific questions involved, just as their least interest is
for the human issues at stake. So far "civil service reform"
has been mainly negative: a purging away of some
of the grosser causes which have influenced appointments
to office. But now there is needed a constructive reform
of civil administration which will develop the agencies
of inquiry, oversight, and publicity required by modern
conditions; and which will necessitate the selection of
public servants of scientifically equipped powers.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. POLITICAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS</h4>

<p>No hard and fast line can be drawn between civil society
and the State. By the State, however, we denote those
conditions of social organization and regulation which are
most fundamental and most general:&mdash;conditions which are
summed up in and expressed through the general will as
manifested in legislation and its execution. As a civil
right is technically focused in the right to use the courts,
"to sue and be sued," that is in the right to have other
claims adjudicated and enforced by a public, impartial
authority, so a political right is technically summed up in
the power to vote&mdash;either to vote directly upon laws or
to vote for those who make and carry out laws. To have
the right in a legislative assembly to speak for or against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
a certain measure; to be able to say "yea" or "nay" upon
a roll-call; to be able to put into a ballot-box a piece of
paper with a number of names written thereon, are not
acts which of themselves possess the inherent value of many
of the most ordinary transactions of daily life. But the
representative and potential significance of political rights
exceeds that of any other class of rights. Suffrage stands
for direct and active participation in the regulation of
the terms upon which associated life shall be sustained, and
the pursuit of the good carried on. Political freedom and
responsibility <i>express an individual's power and obligation
to make effective all his other capacities by fixing the
social conditions of their exercise</i>.</p>

<p><b>Growth of Democracy.</b>&mdash;The evolution of democratically
regulated States, as distinct from those ordered in the
interests of a small group, or of a special class, is the
social counterpart of the development of a comprehensive
and common good. Externally viewed, democracy is a
piece of machinery, to be maintained or thrown away, like
any other piece of machinery, on the basis of its economy
and efficiency of working. Morally, it is the effective
embodiment of the moral ideal of a good which consists in
the development of all the social capacities of every individual
member of society.</p>

<p><b>Present Problems: 1. Distrust of Government.</b>&mdash;Present
moral problems connected with political affairs have to
do with safeguarding the democratic ideal against the influences
which are always at work to undermine it, and with
building up for it a more complete and extensive embodiment.
The historic antecedent of our own governmental
system was the exercise of a monopoly by a privileged
class.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> It became a democratic institution partly because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
the King, in order to secure the monopoly, had to concede
and guarantee to the masses of the people certain rights
as against the oligarchical interests which might rival
his powers; and partly because the centralization of power,
with the arbitrary despotism it created, called out protests
which finally achieved the main popular liberties: safety
of life and property from arbitrary forfeiture, arrest, or
seizure by the sovereign; the rights of free assembly,
petition, a free press, and of representation in the law-making
body.</p>

<p>Upon its face, the struggle for individual liberty was a
struggle against the overbearing menace of despotic rulers.
This fact has survived in an attitude towards government
which cripples its usefulness as an agency of the general
will. Government, even in the most democratic countries,
is still thought of as an external "ruler," operating from
above, rather than as an organ by which people associated
in pursuit of common ends can most effectively co&ouml;perate
for the realization of their own aims. Distrust of government
was one of the chief traits of the situation in which
the American nation was born. It is embodied not only
in popular tradition, and party creeds, but in our organic
laws, which contain many provisions expressly calculated
to prevent the corporate social body from effecting its
ends freely and easily through governmental agencies.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the movement to restrict the
functions of government, the <i>laissez-faire</i> movement, was
in its time an important step in human freedom, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
so much of governmental action was despotic in intention
and stupid in execution. But it is also a mistake to continue
to think of a government which is only the people
associated for the assuring of their own ends as if it
were the same sort of thing as a government which represented
the will of an irresponsible class. The advance
of means of publicity, and of natural and social science,
provides not only protection against ignorant and unwise
public action, but also constructive instrumentalities of
intelligent administrative activities. One of the chief
moral problems of the present day is, then, that of making
governmental machinery such a prompt and flexible
organ for expressing the <i>common</i> interest and purpose
as will do away with that distrust of government
which properly must endure so long as "government" is
something imposed from above and exercised from without.</p>

<p><b>2. Indifference to Public Concerns.</b>&mdash;The multiplication
of private interests is a measure of social progress:
it marks the multiplication of the sources and ingredients
of happiness. But it also invites neglect of the fundamental
general concerns which, seeming very remote, get
pushed out of sight by the pressure of the nearer and
more vivid personal interests. The great majority of men
have their thoughts and feelings well occupied with their
family and business affairs; with their clubs for recreation,
their church associations, and so on. "Politics" becomes
the trade of a class which is especially expert in the
manipulation of their fellows and skilled in the "acceleration"
of public opinion. "Politics" then gets a bad
name, and the aloofness from public matters of those best
fitted, theoretically, to participate in them is further promoted.
The saying of Plato, twenty-five hundred years
ago, that the penalty good men pay for not being interested
in government is that they are then ruled by men
worse than themselves, is verified in most of our American
cities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<p><b>3. Corruption.</b>&mdash;This indifference of the many, which
throws the management of political affairs into the hands
of a few, leads inevitably to corruption. At the best, government
is administered by human beings possessed of
ordinary human frailties and partialities; and, at the best,
therefore, its ideal function of serving impartially the
common good must be compromised in its execution. But
the control of the inner machinery of governmental power
by a few who can work in irresponsible secrecy because of
the indifference and even contempt of the many, incites to
deliberate perversion of public functions into private advantages.
As embezzlement is appropriation of trust
funds to private ends, so corruption, "graft," is prostitution
of public resources, whether of power or of money,
to personal or class interests. That a "public office is a
public trust" is at once an axiom of political ethics and
a principle most difficult to realize.</p>

<p>In our own day, a special field has been opened within
which corruption may flourish, in the development of public
utility companies. Railways, city transportation systems,
telegraph and telephone systems, the distribution of water
and light, require public franchises, for they either employ
public highways or they call upon the State to exercise
its power of eminent domain. These enterprises can
be carried on efficiently and economically only as they
are either monopolies, or quasi-monopolies. All modern
life, however, is completely bound up with and dependent
upon facilities of communication, intercourse, and distribution.
Power to control the various public-service corporations
carries with it, therefore, power to control and
to tax all industries, power to build up and cast down
communities, companies, and individuals, to an extent
which might well have been envied by royal houses of the
past. It becomes then a very special object for great
corporations to control the agencies of legislation and
administration; and it becomes a very special object for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
party leaders and bosses to get control of party machinery
in order to act as brokers in franchises and in special
favors&mdash;sometimes directly for money, sometimes for the
perpetuation and extension of their own power and influence,
sometimes for the success, through influential support
and contribution to party funds, of the national party
with which they are identified.</p>

<p><b>4. Reforms in Party Machinery.</b>&mdash;The last decade or
so of our history has been rife with schemes to improve
political conditions. It has become clear, among other
things, that our national growth has carried with it the
development of secondary political agencies, not contemplated
by the framers of our constitutions, agencies which
have become primary in practical matters. These agencies
are the "machines" of political parties, with their hierarchical
gradation of bosses from national to ward rulers,
bosses who are in close touch with great business interests
at one extreme, and with those who pander to the vices
of the community (gambling, drink, and prostitution) at
the other; parties with their committees, conventions, primaries,
caucuses, party-funds, societies, meetings, and all
sorts of devices for holding together and exciting masses
of men to more or less blind acquiescence.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to point out the advantages which
parties have subserved in concentrating and defining public
opinion and responsibility in large issues; nor to dwell
upon their value in counteracting tendencies which break
up and divide men into a multitude of small groups having
little in common with one another. But behind these advantages
a vast number of abuses have sheltered themselves.
Recent legislation and recent discussion have shown
a marked tendency formally to recognize the part actually
played by party machinery in the conduct of the State,
and to take measures to make this factor more responsible
in its exercise. Since these measures directly affect the
conditions under which the government as the organ of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
the general will does its work of securing the fundamental
conditions of equal opportunity for all, they have a direct
moral import. Such questions as the Australian ballot, the
recognition of party emblems and party groupings of
names; laws for direct primary nominations; the registering
of voters for primary as well as for final elections;
legal control of party committees and party conventions;
publicity of accounts as to the reception and use of party
funds; forbidding of contributions by corporations, are
thus as distinctly moral questions as are bribery and ballot-box
stuffing.</p>

<p><b>5. Reforms in Governmental Machinery.</b>&mdash;Questions
that concern the respective advantages of written versus
unwritten constitutions are in their present state problems
of technical political science rather than of morals. But
there are problems, growing out of the fact that for the
most part American constitutions were written and adopted
under conditions radically unlike those of the present,
which have a direct ethical import. As already noted, our
constitutions are full of evidences of distrust of popular
co&ouml;perative action. They did not and could not foresee
the direction of industrial development, the increased complexity
of social life, nor the expansion of national territory.
Many measures which have proved indispensable
have had therefore to be as it were smuggled in; they
have been justified by "legal fictions" and by interpretations
which have stretched the original text to uses undreamed
of. At the same time, the courts, which are the
most technical and legal of our political organs, are supreme
masters over the legislative branch, the most popular
and general. The distribution of functions between
the states and the nation is curiously ill-adapted to present
conditions (as the discussions regarding railway regulation
indicate); and the distribution of powers between
the state and its municipalities is hardly less so, resting in
theory upon the idea of local self-government, and in prac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>tice
doing almost everything possible to discourage responsible
initiative for the conduct of their own affairs on
the part of municipalities.</p>

<p>These conditions have naturally brought forth a large
crop of suggestions for reforms. It is not intended to
discuss them here, but the more important of them, so far
as involving moral questions, may be briefly noted. The
proposals termed the initiative and the referendum and the
"recall" (this last intended to enable the people to withdraw
from office any one with whose conduct of affairs they
are dissatisfied) are clearly intended to make the ideal of
democratic control more effective in practice. Proposals
for limited or complete woman's suffrage call attention
to the fact that one-half of the citizenship does the political
thinking for the other half, and emphasize the difficulty
under such conditions of getting a comprehensive
social standpoint (which, as we have already seen, is the
sympathetic and reasonable standpoint) from which to
judge social issues. Many sporadic propositions from this
and that quarter indicate a desire to revise constitutions
so as to temper their cast-iron quality and increase their
flexible adaptation to the present popular will, and so as
to emancipate local communities from subjection to State
legislatures in such a way as to give them greater autonomy
and hence greater responsibility, in the management
of their own corporate affairs. It is not the arguments
<i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> that we are here concerned with;
but we are interested to point out that moral issues are
involved in the settlement of these questions. It may,
moreover, be noted that dividing lines in the discussion
are generally drawn, consciously or unconsciously, on the
basis of the degree of faith which exists in the democratic
principle and ideal, as against the class idea in some
of its many forms.</p>

<p><b>6. Constructive Social Legislation.</b>&mdash;The rapid change
of economic methods, the accumulation and concentration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
of wealth, the aggregation of capital and labor into distinct
bodies of corporations and trusts, on one side, and
federated labor unions, on the other; the development of
collective agencies of production and distribution, have
brought to the focus of public attention a large number
of proposals for new legislation, almost all of which have
a direct moral import. These matters are discussed at
length in subsequent chapters (chs. xxii.-xxv.); and so are
passed over here with the reminder that, while on one side
they are questions of the ethics of industry, they are
also questions of the right and wrong use of political power
and authority. We may also note that the theoretical
principle at issue, the extension versus the restriction of
governmental agencies, so far as it is not simply a question
of what is expedient under the given circumstances,
is essentially a question of a <i>generalized</i> versus a <i>partial</i>
individualism. The democratic movement of emancipation
of personal capacities, of securing to each individual
an <i>effective</i> right to count in the order and movement
of society as a whole (that is, in the common good), has
gone far enough to secure to many, more favored than
others, peculiar powers and possessions. It is part of the
irony of the situation that such now oppose efforts to secure
equality of opportunity to <i>all</i> on the ground that these
efforts would effect an invasion of individual liberties and
rights: i.e., of privileges based on inequality. It requires
perhaps a peculiarly sympathetic imagination to see that
the question really involved is not one of magnifying the
powers of the State against individuals, but is one of
making individual liberty a more extensive and equitable
matter.</p>

<p><b>7. The International Problem.</b>&mdash;The development of
national States marks a tremendous step forward in the
realization of the principle of a truly inclusive common
good. But it cannot be the final step. Just as clans, sects,
gangs, etc., are intensely sympathetic within and intensely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
exclusive and jealous without, so States are still arrayed
against States, with patriotism, loyalty, as an internal
virtue, and the distrust and hatred of divisive hostility as
the counterpart vice. The idea of humanity in the abstract
has been attained as a moral ideal. But the political
organization of this conception, its embodiment in law and
administrative agencies, has not been achieved. International
law, arbitration treaties, and even a court like the
Hague tribunal, whose power is sentimental rather than
political, mark steps forward. Nothing could be more
absurd, from the historic point of view, than to regard the
conception of an international State of federated humanity,
with its own laws and its own courts and its own rules for
adjudicating disputes, as a mere dream, an illusion of
sentimental hope. It is a very slight step to take forward
compared with that which has substituted the authority
of national States for the conflict of isolated clans and
local communities; or with that which has substituted a
publicly administered justice for the r&eacute;gime of private war
and retaliation. The argument for the necessity (short
of the attainment of a federated international State with
universal authority and policing of the seas) of preparing
in peace by enlarged armies and navies for the possibility
of war, must be offset at least by recognition that the
possession of irresponsible power is always a direct temptation
to its irresponsible use. The argument that war is
necessary to prevent moral degeneration of individuals
may, under present conditions, where every day brings
its fresh challenge to civic initiative, courage, and vigor,
be dismissed as unmitigated nonsense.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4. THE MORAL CRITERION OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY</h4>

<p>The moral criterion by which to try social institutions
and political measures may be summed up as follows: The
test is whether a given custom or law sets free individual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
capacities in such a way as to make them available for the
development of the general happiness or the common
good. This formula states the test with the emphasis falling
upon the side of the individual. It may be stated from
the side of associated life as follows: The test is whether
the general, the public, organization and order are promoted
in such a way as to equalize opportunity for all.</p>

<p><b>Comparison with the Individualistic Formula.</b>&mdash;The
formula of the individualistic school (in the narrow sense
of that term&mdash;the <i>laissez-faire</i> school) reads: The moral
end of political institutions and measures is the maximum
possible freedom of the individual consistent with his not
interfering with like freedom on the part of other individuals.
It is quite possible to interpret this formula
in such a way as to make it equivalent to that just given.
But it is not employed in that sense by those who advance
it. An illustration will bring out the difference. Imagine
one hundred workingmen banded together in a desire to
improve their standard of living by securing higher
wages, shorter hours, and more sanitary conditions of
work. Imagine one hundred other men who, because they
have no families to support, no children to educate, or
because they do not care about their standard of life,
are desirous of replacing the first hundred at lower wages,
and upon conditions generally more favorable to the
employer of labor. It is quite clear that in offering themselves
and crowding out the others, they are not interfering
with the <i>like</i> freedom on the part of others. The
men already engaged are "free" to work for lower wages
and longer time, if they want to. But it is equally certain
that they are interfering with the <i>real</i> freedom of the
others: that is, with the effective expression of their <i>whole</i>
body of activities.</p>

<p>The formula of "<i>like</i> freedom" artificially isolates some
one power, takes that in the abstract, and then inquires
whether <i>it</i> is interfered with. The one truly moral ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>tion
is what relation this particular power, say the power
to do a certain work for a certain reward, sustains to all the
other desires, purposes, and interests of the individual. How
are <i>they</i> affected by the way in which some one activity is
exercised? It is in them that the concrete freedom of
the man resides. We do not know whether the freedom of
a man is interfered with or is assisted until we have taken
into account his whole system of capacities and activities.
The maximum freedom of one individual consistent with
equal <i>concrete</i> or <i>total</i> freedom of others, would indeed
represent a high moral ideal. But the individualistic
formula is condemned by the fact that it has in mind
only an abstract, mechanical, external, and hence formal
freedom.</p>

<p><b>Comparison with the Collectivistic Formula.</b>&mdash;There
is a rival formula which may be summed up as the subordination
of private or individual good to the public or
general good: the subordination of the good of the part
to the good of the whole. This notion also <i>may</i> be interpreted
in a way which renders it identical with our own
criterion. But it is usually not so intended. It tends to
emphasize quantitative and mechanical considerations.
The individualistic formula tends in practice to emphasize
the freedom of the man who has power at the expense of
his neighbor weaker in health, in intellectual ability, in
worldly goods, and in social influence. The collectivistic
formula tends to set up a static social whole and to prevent
the variations of individual initiative which are necessary
to progress. An individual variation may involve
opposition, not conformity or subordination, to the existing
social good taken statically; and yet may be the sole
means by which the existing State is to progress. Minorities
are not always right; but every advance in right begins
in a minority of one, when some individual conceives
a project which is at variance with the social good as it
<i>has</i> been established.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<p>A true public or social good will accordingly not subordinate
individual variations, but will encourage individual
experimentation in new ideas and new projects,
endeavoring only to see that they are put into execution
under conditions which make for securing responsibility
for their consequences. A just social order promotes in
all its members habits of criticizing its attained goods and
habits of projecting schemes of new goods. It does not
aim at intellectual and moral subordination. Every form
of social life contains survivals of the past which need to
be reorganized. The struggle of some individuals <i>against</i>
the existing subordination of their good to the good of
the whole is the method of the reorganization of the whole
in the direction of a more generally distributed good. Not
order, but orderly progress, represents the social ideal.</p>

<br /><br />

THE ETHICS OF THE ECONOMIC LIFE</h2>


<p>In considering the ethics of the economic life and of
property, so far as this latter topic has not received treatment
elsewhere, we give (1) a general analysis of the ethical
questions involved, (2) a more specific account of the
problems raised by the present tendencies of industry, business,
and property; we follow these analyses with (3) a
statement of principles, and (4) a discussion of unsettled
problems.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. GENERAL ANALYSIS</h4>

<p>Both the economic process and property have three
distinct ethical aspects corresponding respectively to the
ethical standpoint of happiness, character, and social
justice. (1) The economic process supplies men with
goods for their bodily wants and with many of the necessary
means for satisfying intellectual, &aelig;sthetic, and social
needs; property represents permanence and security in
these same values. (2) Through the difficulties it presents,
the work it involves, and the incitements it offers, the economic
process has a powerful influence in evoking skill,
foresight, and scientific control of nature, in forming character,
and stimulating ambition to excel. Property means
power, control, and the conditions for larger freedom.
(3) The economic process has an important social function.
Through division of labor, co&ouml;peration, and exchange
of goods and services, it affords one of the fundamental
expressions of the organic nature of society in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
which members are reciprocally ends to each other. Property,
likewise, is not only a possessing, but a "right," and
thus, like all rights, involves the questions why and how far
society should support the individual in his interests and
claims. Let us examine each of these aspects further.</p>

<p><b>1. The Economic in Relation to Happiness.</b>&mdash;Subject
to the important qualifications to be made below under
this and the succeeding sections, we note first that the
supply of needs and wants by industry and commerce is
ethically a good. A constant increase in production and
consumption is at least a possible factor in a fuller life.
Wealth is a possible condition of weal, even if it is not
to be gratuitously identified with it. Rome is frequently
cited as an example of the evil effects of material wealth.
But it was not wealth <i>per se</i>, but wealth (a) gained by
conquest, and exploitation, rather than by industry; (b)
controlled by a minority; and (c) used in largesses or in
crude spectacles&mdash;rather than democratically distributed
and used to minister to higher wants. The present average
income in the United States is about two hundred
dollars a year per capita, too small a sum to permit
comfortable living, sufficient education for children, and
the satisfaction which even a very moderate taste may
seek. From this point of view we may then ask of any
industrial process or business method whether it is an economical
and efficient method of production, and whether
it naturally tends to stimulate increased production. To
do this is&mdash;so far as it goes&mdash;ethically as well as economically
desirable.</p>

<p>If wealth is a good, it might seem that property must
be judged by the same standard, since it represents security
in the satisfactions which wealth affords. But
there is an important distinction. Wealth means enjoyment
of goods and satisfaction of wants. Property means
the title to the exclusive use or possession of goods. Hence
the increase of property may involve increasing exclusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
of part of the community from wealth, although the owners
of the property may be increasing their own enjoyments.
For, as pointed out very forcibly by Hadley in the first
chapter of his <i>Economics</i>, the public wealth of a community
is by no means equal to the sum of its private property.
If all parks were divided up into private estates,
all schoolhouses controlled by private owners, all water
supplies and highways given into private control, the sum
of private property might be very much increased; but
the public wealth would be decreased. Property is one of
the means of dealing with public wealth. It is important
to bear in mind, however, that it is only one means. Wealth
may be (1) privately owned and privately used; (2) privately
owned and publicly or commonly used; (3) publicly
owned, but privately used; (4) publicly owned and publicly
or commonly used. Illustrations of these four methods
are, for the first, among practically all peoples, clothing
and tools; of the second, a private estate opened to public
use&mdash;as a park; of the third, public lands or franchises
leased to individuals; of the fourth, public highways,
parks, navigable rivers, public libraries. Whether property
in any given case is a means to happiness will depend,
then, largely upon whether it operates chiefly to increase
wealth or to diminish it. The view has not been
infrequent that the wealth of the community is the sum
of its private property. From this it is but a step to
believe "that the acquisition of property is the production
of wealth, and that he best serves the common good who,
other things equal, diverts the larger share of the aggregate
wealth to his own possession."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> The ethical questions
as to the relation of property to happiness involve accordingly
the problem of justice and can be more conveniently
considered under that head.</p>

<p><b>2. Relation to Character.</b>&mdash;Even in its aspect of satisfying
human wants, quantity of production is not the only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
consideration. As was pointed out in the chapters on Happiness,
the satisfaction of any and every want is not
necessarily a moral good. It depends upon the nature of
the wants; and as the nature of the wants reflects the
nature of the man who wants, the moral value of the economic
process and of the wealth it provides must depend
upon the relation of goods to persons. As economists we
estimate values in terms of external goods or commodities;
as ethical students we estimate values in terms of a certain
quality of life. We must ask first how the satisfaction of
wants affects the consumers.</p>

<p><b>Moral Cost of Production.</b>&mdash;Consider next the producers.
It is desirable to have cheap goods, but the
price of goods or service is not measurable solely in
terms of other commodities or service; the price of an
article is also, as Thoreau has said, what it costs in
terms of human life. There is cheap production which
by this standard is dear. The introduction of machinery
for spinning and weaving cotton cheapened cotton cloth,
but the child labor which was supposedly necessary as a
factor in cheap production, involving disease, physical
stunting, ignorance, and frequently premature exhaustion
or death, made the product too expensive to be tolerated.
At least, it was at last recognized as too expensive in
England; apparently the calculation has to be made over
again in every community where a new system of child
labor is introduced. What is true of child labor is true
of many other forms of modern industry&mdash;the price in
human life makes the product dear. The minute subdivision
of certain parts of industry with the consequent monotony
and mechanical quality of the labor, the accidents
and diseases due to certain occupations, the devices to
cheapen goods by ingredients which injure the health of
the consumer, the employment of women under unsanitary
conditions and for excessive hours with consequent
risk to the health of themselves and their offspring&mdash;all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
these are part of the moral price of the present processes
of industry and commerce.</p>

<p>Moreover, the relation of production to physical welfare
is only one aspect of its effects upon life and character.
We may properly ask of any process or system whether
it quickens intelligence or deadens it, whether it necessitates
the degradation of work to drudgery, and whether
it promotes freedom or hampers it. To answer this last
question we shall have to distinguish formal from real
freedom. It might be that a system favorable to the
utmost formal freedom&mdash;freedom of contract&mdash;would result
in the most entire absence of that real freedom which
implies real alternatives. If the only alternative is, this or
starve, the real freedom is limited.</p>

<p><b>Property and Character.</b>&mdash;Viewed on its positive side,
property means an expansion of power and freedom.
To seize, master, and possess is an instinct inbred by
the biological process. It is necessary for life; it is a
form of the <i>Wille zum Leben</i> or <i>Wille zur Macht</i> which
need not be despised. But in organized society possession
is no longer mere animal instinct; through expression
in a social medium and by a social person it
becomes a <i>right</i> of property. This is a far higher capacity;
like all rights it involves the assertion of personality
and of a rational claim upon fellow members of
society for their recognition and backing. Fichte's doctrine,
that property is essential to the effective exercise
of freedom, is a strong statement of its moral importance
to the individual.</p>

<p>Over against these positive values of property are certain
evils which moralists have always recognized, evils
both to the property owner and to society. Avarice, covetousness,
hardness toward others, seem to be the natural
effects of the enormous possibilities of power offered
by property, joined with its exclusive character. The
prophets of Israel denounced the rich, and Jesus's image<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
of the difficulty found by the rich man in entering the
kingdom of God&mdash;a moral society&mdash;has met general acceptance.
Plato's portrayal of the State in which the
wealthy rule sketches the perversion and disobedience of
laws, the jealousies and class hatred, the evasion of taxes
for public defense, and gives the moral outcome:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And henceforth they press forward on the path of money-getting,
losing their esteem for virtue as the esteem for wealth
grows upon them. For can you deny that there is such a
gulf between wealth and virtue, that when weighed as it
were in the two scales of a balance one of the two always
falls, as the other rises?"<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p></div>

<p>Even apart from questions of just distribution, the
moral question arises as to whether an unlimited power
should be given to individuals in this form, and whether
there should be unlimited right of inheritance. But all
these tend to pass over at once into questions of justice.</p>

<p><b>3. Social Aspects.</b>&mdash;The various relations of man to
man, political, friendly, kindred, are developed forms
of the interdependence implicit in the early group life.
A group of units, each independent of the others, would
represent mass only, but such a group as is made up of
men, women, and children, sustaining all the relations
found in present human life, represents something vastly
more than a mass of individuals. Every life draws from
the rest. Man without friendship, love, pity, sympathy,
communication, co&ouml;peration, justice, rights, or duties,
would be deprived of nearly all that gives life its value.</p>

<p>The necessary help from others is obtained in various
ways. Parental, filial, and other kinship ties, friendship
and pity, give rise to certain services, but they are necessarily
limited in their sphere and exact in return a special
attitude that would be intolerable if made universal. The
modern man does not want to be cousin to every one, to
give every one his personal friendship, to be in a perpetual
attitude of receiving favors, or of asking and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
receiving. Formerly the way of getting service from men
outside these means was by slavery. The economic relation
provides for the mutual exchange of goods and
services on a basis of self-respect and equality. Through
its system of contracts it provides for future as well as
present service. It enables each to obtain the services
of all the rest, and in turn to contribute without incurring
any other claims or relations. Nor does it at all diminish
the moral value of these mutual exchanges of goods and
services that they may be paid for. It used to be the
theory that in every bargain one party gained and the
other lost. It is now recognized that a normal transaction
benefits both parties. The "cash payment basis," which
was at first denounced as substituting a mechanical nexus
for the old personal tie, is in reality a means for establishing
a greater independence instead of the older personal
relation of "master" and "servant." It enabled
a man, as Toynbee puts it, to sell his labor like any other
commodity without selling himself.</p>

<p>But while the economic process has these moral possibilities,
the morality of any given system or practice will
depend on how far these are actually realized.</p>

<p>First of all, we may fairly ask of a process, Does it
give to each member the kind of service needed by him?
In economic terms, Does it produce the kinds of goods
which society needs and desires? A method which provides
for this successfully will in so far be providing
against scarcity of some goods and oversupply of others,
and thus against one of the sources of crises, irregularity
of work and wages, and ultimately against suffering and
want.</p>

<p>Secondly, if the process is an expression of the mutual
dependence and service of members who as persons all have,
as Kant puts it, intrinsic worth, and who in our political
society are recognized as equal, we may fairly ask how
it distributes the results of services rendered. Does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
the process tend to a broad and general distribution of
goods in return for services rendered, or to make "the
rich richer and the poor poorer?" Or, from another
point of view, we might ask, Does the process tend to
reward members on a moral or equitable basis, or upon a
basis which is non-moral if not immoral or unjust.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the problem of <i>conflicting services</i> presents
itself under several forms. There is, first, the ever-present
conflict between producer and consumer. Higher wages
and shorter hours are good for the carpenter or the
weaver, until he pays his rent or buys clothes, when he is
interested in cheaper goods. What principle can be employed
to adjust such a question? Again, service to the
consumer may lead a producer to a price-list implying a
minimum of profits. One producer can afford this because
of his larger business, but it will drive his competitor
from the field. Shall he agree to a higher price
at which all can do business, or insist on the lower which
benefits the consumer and also himself? The labor union
is a constant embodiment of the problem of conflicting
services. How far shall it serve a limited group, the
union, at the expense of other workers in the same trade&mdash;non-unionists?
Does it make a difference whether the union
is open to all, or whether the dues are fixed so high as to
limit the membership? Shall the apprentices be limited to
keep up the wage by limiting the supply? If so, is this
fair to the boys or unskilled laborers who would like to
enter? And granting that it is a hardship to these, is
it harder or is it kinder to them than it would be to leave
the issue to the natural weeding out or starving-out
procedure of natural selection in case too many enter
the trade? Shall the hours be reduced and wages raised
as high as possible, or is there a "fair" standard&mdash;fair to
both consumer and laborer? How far may the union
combine with the capitalist to raise prices to the
consumer?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Private Property and Social Welfare.</b>&mdash;The social value
of property is obviously indirect, just as in law, private
rights are regarded as indirectly based on social welfare.
It is society's aim to promote the worth of its members and
to favor the development of their personal dignity and
freedom. Property may, therefore, claim social value in
so far as it serves these ends, unless it interferes with
other social values. The effect of private property has
seemed to some disastrous to community of interest and
feeling. Plato, for example, in his ideal state would
permit his guardians no private property. There would,
then, be no quarrels over "meum" and "tuum," no suits or
divisions, no petty meanness or anxieties, no plundering
of fellow-citizens, no flattery of rich by poor. The medi&aelig;val
church carried out his theory. Even modern
society preserves a certain trace of its spirit. For the
classes that Plato called guardians&mdash;soldiers, judges,
clergy, teachers&mdash;have virtually no property, although
they are given support by society. It would probably
be generally agreed that it is better for the public that
these classes should not have large possessions. But it
is obvious that private property is not the sole cause of
division between individuals and classes. Where there is
a deep-going unity of purpose and feeling, as in the early
Christian community, or in various other companies that
have attempted to practice communism, common ownership
of wealth may be morally valuable as well as practically
possible. But without such unity, mere abolition of property
is likely to mean more bitter divisions, because there
is no available method for giving to each the independence
which is necessary to avoid friction and promote
happiness.</p>

<p>Granting, however, the general position that some
parts of wealth should be privately owned, we must recognize
that a great number of moral problems remain as
to the precise conditions under which society will find it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
wise to entrust the control of wealth to private ownership.
For it must be clearly kept in mind that there is no absolute
right of private property. Every right, legal or
moral, derives from the social whole, which in turn, if it
is a moral whole, must respect the individuality of each
of its members. On this basis moral problems, such as the
following, must be considered. What kind of public
wealth should be given into absolute control of private
individuals or impersonal corporations? Does the institution
in its present form promote the good of those
who have no property as well as of those who have it, or
only of those who own? Would the welfare of society as
a whole be promoted by giving a larger portion of public
wealth into private control, or by retaining a larger proportion
than at present under public ownership? Should
there be any limit to the amount of land or other property
which an individual or corporation may own? Are there
any cases in which private ownership operates rather to
exclude the mass of society from the benefits of civilization
than to give them a share of those benefits? Should a man
be allowed to transmit all his property to his heirs, or
should it be in part reserved by society?</p>

<p>The preceding analysis has aimed to state some of the
problems which belong necessarily to the economic life.
At the present time, however, the moral issues assume a
new and puzzling aspect because of the changes in economic
conditions. It will be necessary to consider briefly
these changed conditions.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. THE PROBLEMS SET BY THE NEW ECONOMIC ORDER</h4>

<p><b>The Collective and Impersonal Organizations.</b>&mdash;Two
changes have come over a large part of the economic and
industrial field. The first is the change from an individual
to a collective basis. The second, which is in part
a consequence of the first, is a change from personal to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
impersonal or corporate relations. Corporations are of
course composed of persons, but when organized for economic
purposes they tend to become simply economic
purpose incorporate, abstracted from all other human
qualities. Although legally they may be subjects of rights
and duties, they have but one motive, and are thus so
abstract as to be morally impersonal. They tend to become
machines for carrying on business, and, as such, may
be as powerful&mdash;and as incapable of moral considerations&mdash;as
other machines.</p>

<p><b>Ethical Readjustment.</b>&mdash;Both these changes require
readjustment of our ethical conceptions. Our conceptions
of honesty and justice, of rights and duties, got their present
shaping largely in an industrial and business order
when mine and thine could be easily distinguished; when it
was easy to tell how much a man produced; when the producer
sold to his neighbors, and an employer had also
the relations of neighbor to his workmen; when responsibility
could be personally located, and conversely a man
could control the business he owned or make individual
contracts; when each man had his own means of lighting,
heating, water supply, and frequently of transportation,
giving no opportunity or necessity for public service corporations.
Such conceptions are inadequate for the present
order. The old honesty could assume that goods belonged
to their makers, and then consider exchanges and
contracts. The new honesty will first have to face a prior
question, <i>Who owns what is collectively produced</i>, and are
the present "rules of the game" distributing the returns
honestly and fairly? The old justice in the economic
field consisted chiefly in securing to each individual his
rights in property or contracts. The new justice must
consider how it can secure for each individual a standard
of living, and such a share in the values of civilization as
shall make possible a full moral life. The old virtue
allowed a man to act more as an individual; the new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
virtue requires him to act in concerted effort if he is to
achieve results. Individualist theories cannot interpret
collectivist facts.</p>

<p>The changes in the economic and industrial processes by
which not only the associated powers of present human
knowledge, skill, and endurance, but also the combined results
of past and future skill and industry are massed
and wielded, depend on several concurrent factors. We
shall notice the social agency, the technique of industry,
the technique of business, the means of fixing value, and
the nature of property.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. THE AGENCIES FOR CARRYING ON COMMERCE AND
INDUSTRY</h4>

<p><b>Early Agencies.</b>&mdash;The early agencies for carrying on
trade and industry were not organized purely for economic
purposes. The kindred or family group engaged in certain
industries, but this was only part of its purpose.
So in the various territorial groups. The Athenian city-state
owned the mines; the German village had its forest,
meadow, and water as a common possession; and the "common"
survived long in English and American custom,
though the cattle pastured on it might be individually
owned. In the United States certain land was reserved for
school purposes, and if retained would now in some cases
be yielding an almost incredible amount for public use;
but it has usually been sold to private individuals. The
national government still retains certain land for forest
reserve, but until the recent movement toward municipal
ownership, the civic community had almost ceased to be
an economic factor in England and America, except in the
field of roads, canals, and the postoffice. In both family
and territorial or community control of industry, we have
the economic function exercised as only one among several
others. The economic helped to strengthen the other bonds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
of unity. On the other hand, the economic motive could
not disentangle itself and stand out in all its naked force.
Within either family or civic group the effects of the acquisitive
instincts were limited by the fact that individuals
in their industrial relations were also kin or neighbors.</p>

<p><b>The Business Enterprise.</b>&mdash;In the business enterprise&mdash;partnership,
company, corporation, "trust,"&mdash;on the
other hand, men are organized solely for economic purposes.
No other interests or ends are regarded. Corporations
organized for this purpose "have no souls," because
they consist of merely the abstract economic interests.
While in domestic and territorial agencies the
acquisitive forces were to some degree beneficially controlled,
they were also injuriously hampered. With the
rise of business enterprise as a distinct sphere of human
action, the way was opened for a new force to manifest
itself. This brought with it both advantages and disadvantages
for the moral and social life as a whole. On
the one hand, it increased tremendously the possibilities
of economic and industrial efficiency. The size of the enterprise
could be as large or as small as was needed for
the most efficient production, and was not, as in family
or community agency, sometimes too small and sometimes
too large. The enterprise could group men according to
their capacity for a particular task, and not, as in the
other forms, be compelled to take a group already constituted
by other than economic or industrial causes. Further,
it could without difficulty dispense with the aged or those
otherwise unsuited to its purposes. When, moreover,
as is coming to be increasingly the case, great corporations,
each controlling scores or even hundreds of millions
of capital, are linked together in common control, we have
a tremendous force which may be wielded as a unit. It is
easy to assume&mdash;indeed it is difficult for managers not
to assume&mdash;that the interests of such colossal organizations
are of supreme importance, and that diplomacy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
tariffs, legislation, and courts should be subordinate. The
moral dangers attaching to such corporations formed
solely for economic purposes are obvious, and have found
frequent illustration in their actual workings. Knowing
few or none of the restraints which control an individual,
the corporation has treated competitors, employees, and
the public in a purely economic fashion. This insures
certain limited species of honesty, but does not include
motives of private sympathy or public duty.</p>

<p><b>The Labor Union.</b>&mdash;Correlative to these corporate
combinations of capital are Labor Unions of various types.
They are usually when first organized more complex in motive,
including social and educational ends, and are more
emotional, or even passionate in conduct. With age they
tend to become more purely economic. In the United States
they have sought to secure better wages, to provide benefits
or insurance in case of sickness and death, and to gain
better conditions in respect of hours, of child-labor, and of
protection against dangerous machinery, explosions, and
occupational diseases. In Great Britain they have also
been successful in applying the co&ouml;perative plan to the purchase
of goods for consumption. The organizations have
been most successful among the skilled trades. For so far
as the aim is collective bargaining, it is evident that the
union will be effective in proportion as it controls the whole
supply of labor in the given trade. In the unskilled forms
of labor, especially with a constant flow of immigration,
it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain organizations
comparable with the organizations of capital. Hence in
conflicts it is natural to expect the moral situations which
frequently occur when grossly unequal combatants are opposed.
The stronger has contempt for the weaker and refuses
to "recognize" his existence. The weaker, rendered
desperate by the hopelessness of his case when he contends
under rules and with weapons prescribed by the stronger,
refuses to abide by the rules and resorts to violence&mdash;only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
to find that by this he has set himself in opposition to all
the forces of organized society.</p>

<p><b>Group Morality Again.</b>&mdash;The striking feature of the
new conditions is that it means a <i>reversion to group morality</i>.
That is, it has meant this so far. Society is struggling
to reassert a general moral standard, but it has not
yet found a standard, and has wavered between a rigid insistence
upon outgrown laws on the one hand, and a more
or less emotional and unreasoned sympathy with new demands,
upon the other.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Group morality meant impersonal,
collective life. It meant loyalty to one's own group,
little regard for others, lack of responsibility, and lack of a
completely social standard. There is, of course, one important
difference. The present collective, impersonal agencies
are not so na&iuml;ve as the old kinship group. They can
be used as effective agencies to secure definite ends, while
the manipulators secure all the advantages of the old
solidarity and irresponsibility.</p>

<p><b>Members and Management.</b>&mdash;The corporation in its idea
is democratic. For it provides for the union of a number
of owners, some of them it may be small owners, under an
elected management. It would seem to be an admirable
device for maintaining concentration of power with distribution
of ownership. But the very size of modern enterprises
and unions prevents direct control by stockholders
or members. They may dislike a given policy, but they are
individually helpless. If they attempt to control, it is almost
impossible, except in an extraordinary crisis, to unite
a majority for common action.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The directors can carry
on a policy and at the same time claim to be only agents of
the stockholders, and therefore not ultimately responsible.
What influence can the small shareholders in a railway<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
company, or a great industrial corporation, or labor union,
have? They unite with ease upon one point only: they
want dividends or results. When an illegal policy is to
be pursued, or a legislature or jury is to be bribed, or a
non-union man is to be "dealt with," the head officials likewise
seek only "results." They turn over the responsibility
to the operating or "legal" department, or to the "educational
committee," and know nothing further. These departments
are "agents" for the stockholders or union, and
therefore, feel quite at ease. The stockholders are sure
they never authorized anything wrong. Some corporations
are managed for the interest of a large number of owners;
some, on the other hand, by ingenious contracts with side
corporations formed from an inner circle, are managed for
the benefit of this inner circle. The tendency, moreover, in
the great corporations is toward a situation in which
boards of directors of the great railroad, banking, insurance,
and industrial concerns are made up of the same
limited group of men. This aggregate property may then
be wielded as absolutely as though owned by these individuals.
If it is used to carry a political election the directors,
according to New York courts, are not culpable.</p>

<p><b>Employer and Employed.</b>&mdash;The same impersonal relation
often prevails between employer and employed. The
ultimate employer is the stockholder, but he delegates
power to the director, and he to the president, and he to
the foreman. Each is expected to get results. The employed
may complain about conditions to the president,
and be told that he cannot interfere with the foreman, and
to the foreman and be told that such is the policy of the
company. The union may serve as a similar buffer. Often
any individual of the series would act humanely or generously,
if he were acting for himself. He cannot be humane
or generous with the property of others, and hence there
is no humanity or generosity in the whole system. This
system seems to have reached its extreme in the creation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
corporations for the express purpose of relieving employers
of any personal responsibility. Companies organized
to insure employers against claims made by employees on
account of injuries may be regarded as a device for distributing
the burden. But as the company is organized,
not primarily to pay damages, as are life insurance companies,
but to avoid such payment, it has a powerful motive
in contesting every claim, however just, and in making
it so expensive to prosecute a claim that the victims may
prefer not to make the attempt. The "law's delay" can
nearly always be counted upon as a powerful defense when
a poor man is plaintiff and a rich corporation is defendant.</p>

<p><b>Relations to the Public.</b>&mdash;The relations of corporations
to the public, and of the public to corporations, are similarly
impersonal and non-moral. A convenient way of approach
to this situation is offered by the ethical, or rather
non-ethical, status of the various mechanical devices which
have come into use in recent years for performing many
economic services. The weighing machines, candy machines,
telephones, are supposed to give a certain service
for a penny or a nickel. But if the machine is out of order,
the victim has no recourse. His own attitude is correspondingly
mechanical. He regards himself as dealing, not
with a person, but with a thing. If he can exploit it or
"beat" it, so much the better. Now a corporation, in the
attitude which it takes and evokes, is about half-way between
the pure mechanism of a machine and the completely
personal attitude of a moral individual. A man is overcharged,
or has some other difficulty with an official of a
railroad company. It is as hopeless to look for immediate
relief as it is in the case of a slot machine. The conductor
is just as much limited by his orders as the machine by its
mechanism. The man may later correspond with some
higher official, and if patience and life both persist long
enough, he will probably recover. But to prevent fraud,
the company is obliged to be more rigorous than a person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
would be who was dealing with the case in a personal fashion.
Hence the individual with a just grievance is likely to
entertain toward the corporation the feeling that he is
dealing with a machine, not with an ethical being, even as
the company's servants are not permitted to exercise any
moral consideration in dealing with the public. They
merely obey orders. Public sentiment, which would hold
an individual teamster responsible for running over a child,
or an individual stage owner responsible for reckless or
careless conduct in carrying his passengers, feels only a
blind rage in the case of a railroad accident. It cannot
fix moral responsibility definitely upon either stockholder
or management or employee, and conversely neither stockholder,
nor manager, nor employee<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> feels the moral restraint
which the individual would feel. He is not wholly
responsible, and his share in the collective responsibility
is so small as often to seem entirely negligible.</p>

<p><b>Relations to the Law.</b>&mdash;The collective business enterprises,
when incorporated, are regarded as "juristic persons,"
and so gain the support of law as well as become
subject to its control. If the great corporation can thus
gain the right of an individual, it can enter the field of free
contract with great advantage. Labor unions have not
incorporated, fearing, perhaps, to give the law control
over their funds. They seek a higher standard of living,
but private law does not recognize this as a right. It
merely protects contracts, but leaves it to the individual
to make the best contract he can. As most wage-earners
have no contracts, but are liable to dismissal at any time,
the unions have seen little to be gained by incorporation.
They have thus missed contact with the institution in
which society seeks to embody, however tardily, its moral
ideas and have been, in a sense, outlaws. They were such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
at first by no fault of their own, for the law treated such
combinations as conspiracies. And they are still at two
decided disadvantages. First, the capitalistic or employing
corporation acting as a single juristic person may
refuse to buy the labor of a union; indeed, according to a
recent decision, it cannot be forbidden to discharge its employees
because of their membership in a union. As the
corporation may employ scores of thousands, and be practically
the only employer of a particular kind of labor, it
can thus enforce a virtual boycott and prevent the union
from selling its labor. It does not need to use a "blacklist"
because the employers are all combined in one "person."
On the other hand, the union is adjudged to act in
restraint of interstate commerce if it boycotts the employing
corporation. The union is here treated as a combination,
not as a single person. The second point in which the
employing body has greatly the legal advantage appears
in the case of a strike. Men are allowed to quit work, but
this is not an effective method of exerting pressure unless
the employer is anxious to keep his plant in operation and
can employ no one else. If he can take advantage of an
open labor market and hire other workmen, the only resource
of the strikers is to induce these to join their ranks.
But they have been enjoined by the courts, not only from
intimidating, but even from persuading<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> employees to quit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
work. The method of procedure in enforcing the injunction,
which enables the judge to fix the offense, eliminate
trial by jury, determine the guilt, and impose any penalty
he deems fit, has all the results of criminal process with
none of its limitations, and forms a most effective agency
against the unions. Where persuasion is enjoined it is
difficult to see how a union can exert any effective pressure
except in a highly skilled trade, where it can control all
the labor supply. In the field of private rights and free
contract, the labor unions are then at a disadvantage because
they have no rights which are of any value for their
purposes, except, under certain conditions, the right to
refuse to work. And since this is, in most cases, a weapon
that injures its wielder far more than his opponent, it is
not effective.</p>

<p>Disappointed in the field of free contract, the labor
unions seek to enlist public agency in behalf of better sanitary
conditions and in prevention of child-labor, long hours
for women, unfair contracts, and the like. Capitalistic
corporations frequently resist this change of venue on the
ground that it interferes with free contract or takes away
property without "due process of law," and many laws
have been set aside as unconstitutional on these grounds,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
several of them no doubt because so drawn as to appear to
be in the interest of a class, rather than in that of the
public. The trend in the direction of asserting larger public
control both under the police power and over corporations
in whose service the public has a direct interest, will
be noted later. Against other corporations the general
public or the unsuccessful competitor has sought legal aid
in legislation against "trusts," but this has mainly proved
to be futile. It has merely induced a change in form of
organization. Nor has it been easy as yet for the law to
exercise any effective control over the business corporation
on any of the three principles invoked&mdash;namely: to
prevent monopoly, to secure the public interest in the case
of public service corporations, and to assert police power.
For penalties by fine frequently fail to reach the guilty
persons, and it is difficult to fix any personal responsibility.
Juries are unwilling to convict subordinate officials of acts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
which they believe to have been required by the policy of the
higher officials, while, on the other hand, the higher officials
are seldom directly cognizant of criminal acts. Gradually,
however, we may believe that the law will find a way
to make both capital and labor organizations respect the
public welfare, and to give them support in their desirable
ends. The co&ouml;perative principle cannot be outlawed; it
must be more fully socialized.</p>


<h4>&sect; 4. THE METHODS OF PRODUCTION, EXCHANGE, AND
VALUATION</h4>

<p><b>The Machine.</b>&mdash;The technique of production has shown
a similar progress from individual to collective method.
The earlier method was that of handicraft. The present
method in most occupations, aside from agriculture, is
that of the machine. But the great economic advantage
of the machine is not only in the substitution of mechanical
power for muscle; it is also in the substitution of collective
for individual work. It is the machine which makes possible
on a tremendously effective basis the division of labor
and its social organization. The extraordinary increase
in wealth during the past century depends upon these two
factors. The machine itself moreover, in its enormous expansion,
is not only a social tool, but a social product. The
invention and discovery which gave rise to the new processes
in industry of every sort were largely the outcome of
scientific researches carried on at public expense to a great
extent by men other than those who finally utilize their
results. They become in turn the instruments for the
production of wealth, which is thus doubly social in origin.</p>

<p>This machine process has an important bearing upon
the factors of character mentioned in our analysis. It
standardizes efficiency; it calls for extraordinary increase
of speed; it requires great specialization of function and
often calls for no knowledge of the whole process. On the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
other hand, it gives a certain sense of power to control and
direct highly complicated machinery. In the more skilled
trades there is more time and resource for intellectual, &aelig;sthetic,
or social satisfactions. The association of workmen
favors discussion of common interests, sympathy, and
co&ouml;peration; this may evoke a readiness to sacrifice individual
to group welfare, which is quite analogous to
patriotic sentiment at its best, even if it is liable to such
violent expressions as characterize patriotic sentiment at
its worst. The association of workmen is one of the most
significant features of modern industry.</p>

<p><b>Capital and Credit.</b>&mdash;The technique of exchange of services
and goods has undergone a transformation from an
individual and limited to a collective and almost unlimited
method. The earlier form of exchange and barter limited
the conduct of business to a small area, and the simpler
form of personal service involved either slavery or some
personal control which was almost as direct. With the use
of money it became possible to make available a far greater
area for exchange and to accumulate capital which represented
the past labors of vast numbers of individuals.
With the further discovery of the possibilities of a credit
system which business enterprise now employs, it is possible
to utilize in any enterprise not merely the results of the
labor of the past, but the anticipated income of the future.
A corporation, as organized at present, issues obligations
in the form of bonds and stock which represent no value as
yet produced, but only the values of labor or privilege anticipated.
The whole technique, therefore, of capital and
credit means a collective business enterprise. It masses the
work and the abilities of thousands and hundreds of thousands
in the past and the future, and wields the product as
an almost irresistible agency to achieve new enterprises or
to drive from the field rival enterprises.</p>

<p><b>Basis of Valuation.</b>&mdash;The whole basis for value and
prices has also been changed. The old basis, employed for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
the most part through the Middle Ages in fixing the value
of labor or goods, was the amount of labor and material
which had been expended. The modern basis is that of supply
and demand. This proceeds on the theory that it is human
wants which after all give value to any product. I may
have expended time and labor upon a book or carving, or
in the cultivation of a new vegetable, or in the manufacture
of an article for apparel, but if no one cares to read the
book or look at the carving, if the vegetable is one that no
one can eat, or the garment is one that no one will wear, it
has no value. Starting then from this, we can see how
the two elements in valuation&mdash;namely, demand and supply&mdash;are
affected by social factors. The demand for an
article depends upon the market: i.e., upon how many
buyers there are, and what wants they have. Modern
methods of communication and transportation have made
the market for goods as large as the civilized world. Education
is constantly awakening new wants. The facilities
for communication, for travel, and for education are constantly
leading one part of the world to imitate the standards
or fashions set by other parts. We have, therefore,
a social standard for valuation which is constantly extending
in area and in intensity.</p>

<p>The other factor in valuation, namely, the supply, is
likewise being affected in an increasing degree by social
forces. With many, if not with most, of the commodities
which are of greatest importance, it has been found that
there is less profit in an unrestricted supply than in a supply
regulated in the interest of the producers. The great
coal mines, the iron industries, the manufacturers of clothing,
find it more profitable to combine and produce a limited
amount. The great corporations and trusts have usually
signalized their acquisition of a monopoly or an approximate
control of any great field of production by shutting
down part of the factories formerly engaged. The supply
of labor is likewise limited by the policies of labor unions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
in limiting the number of apprentices allowed, or by other
means of keeping the union small. Tariffs, whether in the
interest of capital or of labor, are a social control of the
supply. Franchises, whether of steam railroads, street
transportation, gas, electric lighting, or other public
utilities so-called, are all of them in the nature of
monopolies granted to a certain group of individuals.
Their value is dependent upon the general need of
these utilities, coupled with the public limitation of
supply. In many cases the services are so indispensable
to the community that the servant does not need to give
special care or thought to the rendering of especially
efficient service. The increase in population makes the
franchises enormously profitable without any corresponding
increase of risk or effort on the part of the utility
company.</p>

<p>But the most striking illustration of the creation of
values by society is seen in the case of land. That an acre
of land in one part of the country is worth fifty dollars, and
in another part two hundred thousand dollars,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> is not due
to any difference in the soil, nor for the most part to any
labor or skill or other quality of the owner. It is due to
the fact that in the one case there is no social demand,
whereas, in the other, the land is in the heart of a city. In
certain cases, no doubt, the owner of city real estate may
help by his enterprise to build up the city, but even if so
this is incidental. The absentee owner profits as much by
the growth of the city as the foremost contributor to that
growth. The owner need not even improve the property
by a building. This enormous increase in land values has
been called the "unearned increment." In America it is due
very largely to features of natural location and transportation.
It has seemed to some writers, such as Henry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
George, not only a conspicuous injustice, but the root of all
economic evil. It is, no doubt, in many cases, a conspicuous
form of "easy money," but the principle is not different
from that which is involved in nearly all departments of
modern industry. The wealth of modern society is really
a gigantic pool. No individual knows how much he creates;
it is a social product. To estimate what any one should
receive by an attempted estimate of what he has individually
contributed is absolutely impossible.</p>


<h4>&sect; 5. THE FACTORS WHICH AID ETHICAL RECONSTRUCTION</h4>

<p>The two distinctive features of the modern economic situation,
its collective character and its impersonal character,
are themselves capable of supplying valuable aid toward
understanding the ethical problems and in making the
reconstruction required. For <i>the very magnitude of modern
operations and properties serves to bring out more
clearly the principles involved</i>. <i>The impersonal character
allows economic forces pure and simple to be seen in their
moral bearings.</i> Publicity becomes a necessity. Just as
the factories are compelled to have better light, air, and
sanitation than the sweat shops, so public attention is
aroused and the conscience stimulated by practices of great
corporations, although these practices may be in principle
precisely the same as those of private persons which escape
moral reprobation. In some cases, no doubt, the very magnitude
of the operation does actually change the principle.
A "lift" on the road from an oldtime stage-driver, or a
"special bargain" at a country store was not likely to disturb
the balance of competition as a system of free passes
or secret rebates may in modern business. But in other
cases what the modern organizations have done is simply
to exhibit the workings of competition or other economic
forces <i>on a larger scale</i>. An illustration of this is seen in
the familiar fact that a law passed to correct some corpo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>rate
practice is often found to apply to many practices
not contemplated by the makers of the law.</p>

<p>The effect of getting a principle out into the open and
at work on a large scale is to make public judgment clear
and reprobation of bad practices more effective. The impersonal
factor likewise contributes powerfully to make
condemnation easy. Criticism is unhampered by the considerations
which complicate the situation when the conduct
of an individual is in question. The individual may be a
good neighbor, or a good fellow, or have had bad luck.
But no one hesitates to express his opinion of a corporation,
and the average jury is not biased in its favor, whatever
may be true of the bench. Even the plea that the corporation
includes widows and orphans among its shareholders,
which is occasionally put forth to avert interference
with corporate practices, usually falls on unsympathetic
ears. A higher standard will be demanded for business
conduct, a more rigid regard for public service will be
exacted, a more moderate return for invested capital in
public service, and a more liberal treatment of employees
will be insisted upon from corporations than from private
individuals. Nor does the organization of labor escape the
same law. When an agent of a union has been detected in
calling a strike for private gain, public sentiment has been
as severe in condemnation as in the case of corporate officials
who have profited at the expense of stockholders.</p>

<p><b>Summary.</b>&mdash;We may summarize some of the chief points
brought out by our analysis. Modern technique has increased
enormously the productivity of labor, but has increased
its dangers to health and life, and to some extent
diminished its educating and moralizing values. The impersonal
agencies give vast power, but make responsibility
difficult to locate. The collective agencies and the social
contributions make the economic process a great social
pool. Men put in manual labor, skill, capital. Some
of it they have inherited from their kin; some they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
have inherited from the inventors and scientists who have
devised tools and processes; some they have wrought
themselves. This pooling of effort is possible because of
good government and institutions which were created by
statesmen, patriots, and reformers, and are maintained by
similar agencies. The pool is immensely productive. But
no one can say just how much his contribution earns.
Shall every one keep what he can get? Shall all share
alike? Or shall there be other rules for division&mdash;either
made and enforced by society or made by the individual
and enforced by his own conscience? Are our present rules
adequate to such a situation as that of the present? These
are some of the difficult questions that modern conditions
are pressing upon the man who thinks.</p>

431-440) uphold sweeping injunctions against persuasion, no matter

of a person, even though successfully directed to driving him out
of business, is not actionable." But for a union to hire laborers away
from an employer by money or transportation is not "lawful competition."
The object is assumed by the court to be malicious, i.e., the
injury of the employer. The court does not entertain the possibility
that to obtain an eight-hour day is as lawful an aim for the
labor union as to acquire property is for an employer. The decision
shows clearly the difference in legal attitude toward pressure exerted
by business corporations for the familiar end of acquisition, and that
exerted by the union for the novel end of a standard of living.
The court regards the injury to others as incidental in the former, but
as primary and therefore as malicious in the latter. It may be that
future generations will regard this judicial psychology somewhat
as we regard some of the cases cited above, ch. xxi. Other courts
have not always taken this view, and have permitted persuasion
unless it is employed in such a manner or under such circumstances
as to "operate on fears rather than upon their judgments or their
sympathies" (17., <i>N. Y. Supp.</i>, 264). For other cases, <i>Am. and Eng.

<h2><small>CHAPTER XXIII</small>

<br /><br />

SOME PRINCIPLES IN THE ECONOMIC ORDER</h2>


<p>Certain problems suggested by the foregoing analysis
are unsettled, for the issues are so involved, and in some
cases, both the facts and their interpretations are so much
in controversy, that we cannot yet formulate sure moral
judgments. On the other hand, certain principles emerge
with a good degree of clearness. We state some of the
more obvious.</p>

<p><b>1. Wealth and Property are Subordinate in Importance
to Personality.</b>&mdash;The life is more than meat. Most
agree to this, stated abstractly, but many fail to make
the application. They may sacrifice their own health,
or human sympathy, or family life; or they may consent
to this actively or passively as employers, or consumers,
or citizens, in the case of others. A civilization which
loses life in providing the means to live is not highly
moral. A society which can afford luxuries for some cannot
easily justify unhealthful conditions of production,
or lack of general education. An individual who gratifies
a single appetite at the expense of vitality and efficiency
is immoral. A society which considers wealth or
property as ultimate, whether under a conception of "natural
rights" or otherwise, is setting the means above the
end, and is therefore unmoral or immoral.</p>

<p><b>2. Wealth Should Depend on Activity.</b>&mdash;The highest
aspect of life on its individual side is found in active and
resolute achievement, in the embodying of purpose in action.
Thought, discovery, creation, mark a higher value
than the satisfaction of wants, or the amassing of goods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
If the latter is to be a help it must stimulate activity,
not deaden it. Inherited wealth without any accompanying
incitement from education or class feeling or public
opinion would be a questionable institution from this point
of view. Veblen in his <i>Theory of the Leisure Class</i>
points out various forms of degeneration that may attend
upon leisure, when leisure means not merely release from
mechanical labor in the interest of more intellectual activity,
but a relinquishing of all serious labor. As the race
has made its ascent in the presence of an environment
which has constantly selected the more active persons, society
in its institutions and consciously directed processes
may well plan to keep this balance between activity and
reward. Modern charity has adopted this principle. We
fear to pauperize by giving aid to the poor unless we can
provide some form of self-help. But in its treatment of
the rich, society is not solicitous. Our provisions for inheritance
of property undoubtedly pauperize a certain
proportion of those who inherit. Whether this can be
prevented without interfering with motives to activity on
the part of those who acquire the property, or whether
the rich thus pauperized are not as well worth saving to
society as the poor, will undoubtedly become more pressing
problems as the number of inheritors increases, and society
recognizes that it may have a duty to its idle rich
as well as to its idle poor.</p>

<p><b>3. Public Service Should Go Along with Wealth.</b>&mdash;Note
that we do not say, "wealth should be proportionate
to public service." This would take us at once into the
controversy between the individualist and the socialist
which we shall consider later among the unsettled problems.
The individualist, as represented, for example, by
Herbert Spencer, would say that except for the young,
the aged, or the sick, reward should be proportioned to
merit. The socialist, on the other hand, is more inclined
to say, "From each according to his ability, to each ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>cording
to his needs." In either case, it is assumed that
there should be public service. Leaving for later consideration
the question whether we can fix any quantitative
rule, let us notice at this time why some service is a fundamental
moral principle.</p>

<p>Such service in the form of some economically useful
contribution, whether to the production and distribution
of goods, to the public order, to education, to the satisfaction
of &aelig;sthetic and religious wants, might be demanded
as a matter of common honesty. This would be
to treat it as a just claim made by society upon each of
its members. There is, of course, no legal claim. The
law is far from adopting as a universal maxim, "If any
man will not work, neither let him eat." Vagrancy is not
a term applied to all idlers. It is sufficient for the law if
some of a man's ancestors obtained possession and title by
service, or force, or gift. Modern law, in its zeal to
strengthen the institution of property, releases all the
owner's posterity forever from the necessity of any useful
service. The old theology used to carry the conception
of inherited or imputed sin and merit to extremes
which modern individualism rejects. But the law&mdash;at
least in the United States&mdash;permits a perpetual descent
of inherited property; i.e., of inherited permission to receive
from society without rendering any personal return.
Theologically and morally, however, the man of to-day
repudiates any conception which would reduce him to a
shadow of another. He wishes to stand on his own feet,
to be rewarded or blamed according to his own acts, not
because of a deed of some one else. To follow out this
principle in the economic sphere would require that every
man who receives aught from others should feel in duty
bound to render some service. Merely "to have been
born" is hardly sufficient in a democratic society, however
munificent a contribution to the social weal the French
aristocrat may have felt this to be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is only one aspect of the case to say that society
may claim service as a just due. There is another aspect&mdash;what
this service means to the person himself. It
is his opportunity to fulfill his function in the social organism.
Now a person is as large as his purpose and
will. The person, therefore, who identifies his purposes
with the welfare of the public is thereby identifying himself
with the whole social body. He is no longer himself
alone; he is a social power. Not only the leader of society,
but every efficient servant makes himself an organ through
which society itself acts and moves forward. This is perhaps
most conspicuous in the case of the great inventors
or organizers of industry and society. By serving civilization
they have become its bearers and have thus shared
its highest pulses. But it is true of every laborer. As
he is an active contributor he becomes creative, not merely
receptive.</p>

<p><b>4. The Change from Individual to Collective Methods,
of Industry and Business Demands a Change from Individual
to Collective Types of Morality.</b>&mdash;Moral action is
either to accomplish some positive good or to hinder
some wrong or evil. But under present conditions the
individual by himself is practically helpless and useless
for either purpose. It was formerly possible for a man
to set a high standard and live up to it, irrespective of
the practice or co&ouml;peration of others. When a seller's
market was limited to his acquaintance or a limited territory,
it might well be that honesty or even fair dealing
was the best policy. But with the changes that have come
in business conditions the worse practices, like a baser
coinage, tend to drive out the morally better. This may
not apply so thoroughly to the relations between seller
and buyer, but it applies to many aspects of trade. A
merchant may desire to pay his women clerks wages on
which they can support life without selling their souls.
But if his rival across the street pays only half the wage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
necessary for subsistence, it is evident the former is in
so far at a disadvantage. Extend the same policy. Let
the former have his goods made under good conditions
and the latter have no scruple against "sweating"; let
the former pay taxes on an honest estimate and the latter
"see" the assessor, or threaten to move out of town if
he is assessed for more than a figure named by himself;
let the former ask only for a fair chance, while the latter
secures legislation that favors his own interests, or gets
specifications for bids worded so that they will exclude
his opponents, or in selling to public bodies "fixes" the
councils or school committees, or obtains illegal favors
in transportation. Let this continue, and how long
will the former stay in the field? Even as regards quality
of goods, where it would seem more plausible that honest
dealing might succeed, experience has shown that this
depends on whether the frauds can be easily detected.
In the case of drugs and goods where the adulterations
cannot be readily discovered, there is nothing to offset the
more economical procedure of the fraudulent dealer. The
fact that it is so difficult to procure pure drugs and
pure food would seem to be most plausibly due to the fatal
competition of the adulterated article.</p>

<p>Or, suppose a person has a little property invested in
some one of the various corporations which offer the
most convenient method for placing small sums as
well as large. This railroad defies the government by
owning coal mines as well as transporting the product;
that public service corporation has obtained its franchise
by bribery; this corporation is an employer of child labor;
that finds it less expensive to pay a few damage suits&mdash;those
it cannot fight successfully&mdash;than to adopt devices
which will protect employees. Does a man, or even
an institution, act morally if he invests in such corporations
in which he finds himself helpless as an individual
stockholder?  And if he sells his stock at the market<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
price to invest the money elsewhere, is it not still the price
of fraud or blood? If, finally, he buys insurance for his
family's support, recent investigation has shown that he
may have been contributing unawares to bribery of legislatures,
and to the support of political theories to which
he may be morally opposed. The individual cannot be
moral in independence. The modern business collectivism
forces a collective morality. Just as the individual cannot
resist the combination, so individual morality must
give place to a more robust or social type.</p>

<p><b>5. To Meet the Change to Corporate Agency and
Ownership, Ways Must be Found to Restore Personal
Control and Responsibility.</b>&mdash;Freedom and responsibility
must go hand in hand. The "moral liability limited"
theory cannot be accepted in the simple form in which
it now obtains. If society holds stockholders responsible,
they will soon cease to elect managers merely on an economic
basis and will demand morality. If directors are
held personally responsible for their "legal department,"
or union officials for their committees, directors and officials
will find means to know what their subordinates are
doing. "Crime is always personal," and it is not usual
for subordinates to commit crimes for the corporation
against the explicit wishes of the higher officials. In certain
lines the parties concerned have voluntarily sought
to restore a more personal relation.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> It has been found
profitable to engage foremen who can get on smoothly
with workmen. It has proved to be good economy to treat
men, whether they sell labor or buy it, with respect
and fairness.</p>

<p>The managers of some of the great public service corporations
have also recently shown a disposition to recognize
some public obligations, with the na&iuml;ve admission that
this has been neglected. Labor unions are coming to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
the need of conciliating public opinion if they are to gain
their contests.</p>

<p><b>6. To Meet the Impersonal Agencies Society Must
Require Greater Publicity and Express Its Moral Standards
More Fully in Law.</b>&mdash;Publicity is not a cure for
bad practices, but it is a powerful deterrent agency so
long as the offenders care for public opinion and not
solely for the approval of their own class. Professor
Ross<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> maintains that in the United States classes are
still so loosely formed that general approval is desired
by the leaders. Hence he urges that it is possible to
enforce moral standards by the "grilling of sinners."
But to make this "grilling" a moral process society needs
much more accurate information and a more impartial
basis for selecting its sinners than present agencies
afford. The public press is itself in many respects one
of the most conspicuous examples of the purely economic
motive. The newspaper or magazine must interest readers
and not displease advertisers. The news is selected, or
colored, or worked up to suit particular classes. If a
speaker says what the reporter does not regard as interesting
he is likely to find himself reported as saying
something more striking. Publicity bureaus are able to
point with pride to the amount of matter, favorable to
certain interests, which they place before the public as
news. The particular interests singled out for "exposure"
are likely to be determined more by the anticipated effects
on circulation or advertising than by the merits of the
case. It is scarcely more satisfactory to leave all the
education of public opinion to commercial control than
to leave all elementary education to private interests.
Publicity&mdash;scientific investigation and public discussion&mdash;is
indeed indispensable, and its greatest value is probably
not in the exhilarating discharge of righteous indignation,
but in the positive elevation of standards, by giv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>ing
completer knowledge and showing the fruits of certain
practices. A large proportion of the public will wish to
do the right thing if they can see it clearly, and can have
public support, so that right action will not mean suicide.</p>

<p>But the logical way to meet the impersonal character
of modern economic agencies is by the moral consciousness
embodied in an impersonal agency, the law. The
law is not to be regarded chiefly as an agency for punishing
criminals. It, in the first place, defines a standard;
and, in the next place, <i>it helps the morally disposed to
maintain this standard by freeing him from unscrupulous
competition</i>. It is a general principle that to resort to
the law is an ethical gain only when the getting something
done is more important than to get it done from the
right motive. This evidently applies to acts of corporate
bodies. We do not care for their motives. We are not
concerned to save their souls. We are concerned only
for results&mdash;just the place where we have seen that the
personal responsibility breaks down. The value of good
motives and moral purpose is in this case located in those
who strive to secure and execute progressive legislation
for the public good, and in the personal spirit with which
this is accepted and carried out by officials.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p><b>7. Every Member of Society Should Share in Its
Wealth and in the Values Made Possible by It.</b>&mdash;The
quantitative basis of division and the method for giving
each a share belong to the unsettled problems. But the
worth and dignity of every human being of moral capacity
is fundamental in nearly every moral system of modern
times. It is implicit in the Christian doctrine of the
worth of the soul, in the Kantian doctrine of personality,
in the Benthamic dictum, "every man to count as one."
It is imbedded in our democratic theory and institutions.
With the leveling and equalizing of physical and mental
power brought about by modern inventions and the spread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
of intelligence, no State is permanently safe except on a
foundation of justice. And justice cannot be fundamentally
in contradiction with the essence of democracy.
This means that wealth must be produced, distributed,
and owned justly: that is, so as to promote the individuality
of every member of society, while at the same
time he must always function as a member, not as an
individual. In defining justice some will place freedom
first; others, a standard of living. Some will seek fairness
by distributing to each an actual share of the
goods; others, by giving to each a fair chance to get
his share of goods. Others again have held that if no
moral purpose is proposed and each seeks to get what he
can for himself, the result will be a just distribution because
of the beneficent effects of competition. Still others
have considered that if the economic process has once been
established on the basis of contracts rather than status
or slavery, justice may be regarded as the maintenance
of these contracts, whatever the effect in actual benefits.
These views will be considered under the next topic as
unsettled problems.</p>

UNSETTLED PROBLEMS IN THE ECONOMIC
ORDER</h2>


<p>Under this head we propose to consider one general
and three special problems on which society is at present
at work, framing new moral standards to meet new conditions.
Many of the questions involved in the new order
marshal themselves under a single antithesis. Will the
moral values of wealth be most fully secured and justly
distributed by leaving to individuals the greatest possible
freedom and holding them morally responsible, or by social
agency and control? The first theory is known as <i>individualism</i>.
The most convenient term for the second
position would be <i>socialism</i>.</p>

<p>Socialism, however, is, for many, an epithet rather than
a scientific conception. It is supposed to mean necessarily
the abolition of all private enterprise or private property.
In its extreme form it might mean this, as individualism
in its extreme form would mean anarchy. But as a practical
ethical proposition we have before us neither the
abolition of public agency and control&mdash;extreme individualism&mdash;nor
the abolition of private agency and control.
We have the problem of getting the proper amount
of each in order that the highest morality may prevail.
Each theory professes to desire the fullest development
and freedom of the individual. The individualist seeks
it through formal freedom and would limit public agency
to a minimum. The socialist is willing to permit limitations
on formal freedom in order to secure the "real"
freedom which he regards as more important and sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>stantial.
Between the extremes, and borrowing from each,
is a somewhat indefinite programme known as the demand
for equal opportunity. Let us consider each in a brief
statement and then in a more thorough analysis.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE POSITIONS OF INDIVIDUALISM
AND OF PUBLIC AGENCY AND CONTROL</h4>

<p><b>1. Individualism.</b>&mdash;Individualism<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> believes that each
man can secure his own welfare better than any one else
can secure it for him. It further holds that society is
made up of individuals, and hence, if each is provided for,
the welfare of the whole is secured. Such goods as are
social can be secured by voluntary association. Believing
that the course of civilization has been "from status to
contract," it makes free contract its central principle.
It should be the chief business of organized society to
maintain and safeguard this freedom. It locates the
important feature of freedom precisely in the act of
assent, rather than in any consideration of whether the
after consequences of the assent are good or bad; nor does
it ask what motives (force and fraud aside) brought about
the assent, or whether there was any other alternative. In
other words, it regards formal freedom as fundamental. If
not in itself all that can be desired, it is the first step, and
the only one which law need recognize. The individual may
be trusted to take other steps, if protected in this. The
only restriction upon individual freedom should be that it
must not interfere with the equal freedom of others. In
the economic sphere this restriction would mean, "must
not interfere by force." The theory does not regard economic
pressure by competition as interference. Hence
it favors free competition. Leaving out of account benevolence,
it holds that in business each should be allowed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
or even recommended, to seek his own advantage. But
when the question as to the justice of the distribution
reached by this method is raised, a division appears between
the <i>democratic</i> individualists and the "<i>survival of
the fittest</i>" individualists. The democratic individualists&mdash;Adam
Smith, Bentham, Mill<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>&mdash;believed that individualism
would promote the welfare of <i>all</i> members of
society. The "survival of the fittest" school maintains
that the welfare of the race or of civilization depends on
the sifting and selecting process known as the "struggle
for existence." If the "fittest" are thus selected and survive,
it matters not so much what is the lot of the rest.
We must choose between progress through aristocratic
selection and degeneration through democratic leveling.</p>

<p><b>2. Theory of Public Agency and Control.</b>&mdash;Socialism
(using the word in a broad sense) holds that society should
secure to all its members the goods of life. It holds that
an unrestrained liberty of struggle for existence may
secure the survival of the strongest, but not necessarily
of the morally best. The individualist's theory emphasizes
formal freedom. "Seek first freedom and all other things
will be added." The socialist view emphasizes the content.
It would have all members of society share in education,
wealth, and all the goods of life. In this it agrees
with democratic individualism. But it considers this impossible
on the basis of individual effort. To hold that
society as a whole can do nothing for the individual either
ignores social goods or supposes the social will, so powerful
for democracy in the political sphere, to be helpless
and futile in the economic world. To assume that all
the control of economic distribution&mdash;the great field of
justice&mdash;may be left to individual freedom and agency,
is as archaic as to leave the collection of taxes, the administration
of provinces, and the education of citizens to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
private enterprise. It regards the unregulated struggle
for existence as economically wasteful and morally vicious,
both in its inequality of distribution and in the motives
of egoism on which it relies. Individualism, on the other
hand, so far as it is intelligent and does not lump socialism
with anarchy and all other criticisms on the established
order, regards socialism as ignoring the supreme importance
of active personal effort, and the value of freedom
as the keynote to progress.</p>

<p><b>3. Equal Opportunity.</b>&mdash;An intermediate view has for
its maxim, "equal opportunity." It holds with individualism
that the active personality is to be stimulated and
made a prime end. But because it believes that not merely
a few but all persons should be treated as ends, it finds
individualism condemned. For it holds that an unregulated
struggle for existence does not secure the end individualism
professes to seek. When individuals start in
the race handicapped by differences in birth, education,
family, business, friends, and inherited wealth, <i>there is
no selection of ability</i>; there is <i>selection of the privileged</i>.
Hence it would borrow so much from socialism as to give
each individual a "fair start." This would include public
schools, and an undefined amount of provision for sanitation,
and for governmental regulation of the stronger.</p>

<p>It is manifest, however, that this theory of the "square
deal" is a name for a general aim rather than for a
definite programme. For a "square deal," or equality of
opportunity, might be interpreted to call for a great
variety of concrete schemes, ranging all the way from an
elementary education up to public ownership of all the tools
for production, and to abolition of the right to bequeath or
inherit property. The peoples of America, Europe, and
Australasia are at present working out policies which combine
in various degrees the individualistic and the socialistic
views. Most have public schools. Some have provision
for old age and accident through either mutual or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
State systems of insurance and pensions. Let us analyze
the moral aspects of the two opposing theories more
thoroughly. It is obvious that the third view is only
one of a number of mediating positions.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. INDIVIDUALISM OR FREE CONTRACT ANALYZED: ITS
VALUES</h4>

<p><b>Efficiency in Production.</b>&mdash;Individualism can make out
a strong case in respect to several of the ethical qualities
which are demanded: viz., efficiency in production of goods,
stimulation of active and forceful character, promotion
of freedom and responsibility, encouragement to wide
diversification of occupation and thus of services, and,
finally, the supply to society of the kinds of goods which
society wants. It would be absurd to credit the enormous
increase in production of wealth during the past century
to individualism alone, ignoring the contributions of
science and education which have been mainly made under
social auspices. It would be as absurd to credit all the
gains of the century in civilization and freedom to individualism
as it would be to charge all the wretchedness and
iniquity of the century to this same policy. But, setting
aside extravagant claims, it can scarcely be doubted
that Adam Smith's contentions for greater individual
freedom have been justified as regards the tests named.
Granting that the great increase in amount and variety
of production, and in means of communication and distribution,
has been primarily due to two agencies, the machine
and association, it remains true that individualism
has permitted and favored association and has stimulated
invention.</p>

<p><b>Initiative and Responsibility.</b>&mdash;Moreover, the general
policy of turning over to individuals the power and responsibility
to regulate their own acts, is in accord with
one great feature of moral development.  The evolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
of moral personality, as traced in our early chapters,
shows the individual at first living as a member of a kinship
group which determines his economic as well as his
religious and social life, and permits him neither to strike
out independently, nor, on the other hand, to suffer want
so long as the group has supplies. Individual initiative
and responsibility have steadily increased, and the economic
development has undoubtedly strengthened the
development of religious, political, and moral freedom.
It is the combination of these which gives the person of
to-day the worth and dignity belonging to autonomy,
self-government, and democracy.</p>

<p><b>Regulation of Production.</b>&mdash;Further, it may be said
that supply and demand, individualism's method of regulating
prices and the kinds of goods produced, not only
accords with a principle of freedom, but also gets
those goods made which society most needs or wants.
If goods of a certain kind are scarce, the high price stimulates
production. While it permits crises, panics, and
hardship, it at least throws the burden of avoiding hardship
upon the foresight of a great many: namely, all
producers, rather than upon a few persons who might be
designated for the purpose. In thus providing a method
to find out what society wants and how much, it is performing
a social service, and, as we have pointed out, it
is none the less a service because the goods are to be
paid for; it is all the more so because they can be paid
for. So far, then, individualism has a strong case.</p>


<h4>&sect; 3. CRITICISMS UPON INDIVIDUALISM</h4>

<p>There is undoubtedly great waste in some of its methods,
e.g., its advertising and its competitions, but the
most serious objections to individualism are not to be
found here; they arise in connection with the other ethical
criteria of economic morality.  They fall chiefly under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
two heads. (1) Does individualism provide for real as
well as formal freedom? (2) Does it distribute the benefits
widely or to the few? Does it distribute them justly
or unjustly?</p>

<p><b>It Does Not Secure Real Freedom.</b>&mdash;The distinction
between real and formal<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> freedom has been forced into
prominence by several causes. The division of labor
trains a man for a specific kind of work. If there is
no opening in this he is unable to find work. The continual
invention of improved machinery is constantly displacing
particular sets of workers and rendering their special
training worthless. A business panic causes immediate
discharge of thousands of laborers. A "trust" closes
several of its shops, and workmen who have purchased
homes must lose their jobs or their investments, or perhaps
both. The employer is no less limited in his conduct
by the methods of competing firms; but it is the
wage-workers who have felt this lack of real freedom
most keenly. Theoretically, no one is forced to labor.
Every one is free to choose whether he will work, and
what work he will do. But in effect, freedom of choice
depends for its value upon what the alternative is. If
the choice is, do this or&mdash;starve&mdash;the freedom is not worth
much. Formal freedom excludes constraint by the direct
control or will of others. It excludes violence or fear of
violence. But subjection to the stress or fear of want,
or to the limits imposed by ignorance, is just as fatal to
freedom. Hunger is as coercive as violence; ignorance fetters
as hopelessly as force. Whether a man has any choice
of occupation, employment, residence, or wage, depends
on his physical strength, education, family ties, and accumulated
resources, and on the pressure of present need.
To speak of free contract where there is gross inequality
between the parties, is to use a mere form of words. Free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
contract in this case means simply the right of the
stronger to exploit the weaker.</p>

<p><b>Individualism and Justice.</b>&mdash;Individualists, as stated,
belong to two very different schools, which we may call
the democratic and aristocratic, or perhaps more correctly,
if we may coin a word, "oligocratic." Democratic
individualism would have every man count as one. It
would distribute benefits widely. It holds that since society
is made up of individuals all social goods will be
secured if each individual seeks and finds his own. Aristocratic
individualism<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> has been re&euml;nforced by the Darwinian
theory of the struggle for existence as a condition
for "survival of the fittest," by race prejudice, and
by imperialism. It holds that civilization is for the few
"best," not necessarily for the many. Progress lies
through the selection of the few efficient, masterful, aggressive
individuals, races, or nations. Individualism is
a policy which favors these few. It is Nature's method
of dealing. It is of course regrettable that there should
be weak, backward, ineffective individuals or races, but
their exploitation serves the advance of the rest, and
benevolence or charity may mitigate the most painful
results.</p>

<p>The older economists of democratic individualism could
properly claim two respects in which economic justice was
furthered by economic processes under free management
and exchange. The social body is in truth made up of
members, and the old policy had been to tie up the members
to make the body grow. It did promote justice
to remove needless and excessive restrictions. In the second
place, it is true, as the economists insisted, that in
a free exchange each party profits if he gets what he
wants. There is mutual benefit, and so far as this goes
there is an element of justice. But while the benefit may
be mutual, the <i>amount</i> of advantage each gets is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
necessarily the same, and if the party who has greater
shrewdness or resources takes advantage of a great need
on the part of the other, the result may be a very unequal
division. Exchanges of a birthright for a mess of pottage
will be common. Very well, says the individualist,
Esau will know better next time&mdash;or if he doesn't, he is
an object for charity. But the trouble is that even if
Esau does "know better" he is in even poorer condition
next time to make a bargain if his birthright is gone;
besides, if starvation or misery for himself or his family
is his only alternative, what good will it do him to "know
better"? Can the result, then, be just or fair? This
depends on how we define "just" and "fair." If we take
a purely formal view and make formal freedom of contract
the only criterion, then any price is fair which both
parties agree to. The law for the most part takes this
view, assuming absence of force or fraud. But this leaves
out of account everything except the bare formal act of
assent. It is too abstract a conception of personality on
which to base a definition of justice. To get the true
organic relation of mutual service and benefit by a system
of individualism we must have the two parties to the bargain
equal. <i>But in a large part of the exchange of business
and services the two parties are not equal.</i> One has
greater shrewdness, better education, more knowledge of
the market, more accumulated resources, and, therefore,
less pressing need than the other. The moral consciousness
will call prices or contracts unfair where the stronger
takes advantage of the weaker's necessities, even if the law
does not.</p>

<p><b>Competition.</b>&mdash;The fact of competition is depended
upon by the individualist to obviate the disadvantages
of the weaker party. If A is ignorant of the market, B
may impose upon him; but if C and D are competing with
B for A's goods or services, A will soon find out what
they are "worth." That is, he will get for them a social<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
and not a purely individual valuation. There is doubtless
such a gain to A. But in considering competition
as removing the objections to the unfairness possible in bargaining,
we must bear in mind two things. First, competition
cuts both ways. It helps A when several compete
for his goods or labor; but, on the other hand, it may
ruin one of the competitors. If A is a laborer, it is a
good thing if X, Y, and Z, employers, compete for his
services. But if the boot is on the other foot, if B, C,
and D also are laborers and compete with A for a place,
we have the conditions which may lead to the sweat-shop.
Whether there is any better way to avoid unequal distribution
will be considered later. The second and seemingly
fatal objection to competition as a means to justice,
is that <i>free competition under an individualistic system
tends to destroy itself</i>. For the enormous powers which
the new forms of economic agency and technique give to
the individual who can wield them, enable him to crush
competitors. The process has been repeated over and
over within the past few years in various fields. The
only way in which a semblance of competition has been
maintained in railroad business has been by appeal to the
courts. This is an appeal to maintain individualism by
checking individualism, and as might be expected from
such a contradictory procedure, has accomplished little.
Nor can it be maintained that the evils may be obviated,
as Spencer holds, by private restraints on excessive competition.
As already pointed out, if one of a body of
competitors is unscrupulous, the rest are necessarily at a
disadvantage. Under present conditions individualism cannot
guarantee, and in many cases cannot permit, just distribution
and a true organic society.</p>

<p>The other school of individualists is not disturbed by
inequality of goods. It frankly accedes to the logic of
unrestrained competition. It stakes its case upon the
importance for social welfare of the exceptionally gifted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
few. It is important to have their services. It can have
them only on terms which they set, as they will not work
unless there is sufficient motive. It is, on this view, perfectly
just that all the enormous increase of wealth due
to modern methods should go to the few leaders, for their
ability has produced it all. "The able minority of men
who direct the labor of the majority are the true producers
of that amount of wealth by which the annual
total output, in any given community, exceeds what would
have been produced by the laborers if left to their own
devices, whether working as isolated units or in small
self-organized groups, and controlled by no knowledge or
faculties but such as are possessed in common by any
one who can handle a spade or lay one brick upon
another."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Either from the standpoint of natural rights or from
that of utilitarianism it is proper, according to this
school, that all the increasing wealth of society, now and
in all future time, should go to the few. For, on the one
view, it belongs to the few since they have produced it;
and, on the other, it must be given them if society is to
have their services. It is possible they may not claim
it all for their exclusive possession. They may be pleased
to distribute some of it in gifts. But this is for them
to say. The logical method for carrying out this programme
would require an absolute abandonment by the
people as a whole, or by their representatives, or the
courts, of any attempt to control economic conditions.
The courts would be limited to enforcing contracts and
would cease to recognize considerations of public interest
except in so far as these were accepted by the able minority.
All such legislation as imposes any check upon the freedom
of the individual is mischievous. Under this head
would presumably come regulation of child labor, of
hours, of sanitary conditions, of charges by railroads,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
gas companies, and other public service corporations.
Graded income or inheritance taxes are also to be condemned
from this standpoint. It should in fairness be
added that while its upholders do not allege as their main
argument that individualism is for the interest of the
many, they hold, nevertheless, that the many are really
better off under individualism than under socialism. For
since all the increase in wealth is due to the able few whom
individualism produces, and since some of this increase, in
cases where the few compete for the custom or labor of
the many, may fall to the share of the many or else
be given them outright by the more generous, it appears
that the only hope for the many lies through the few.</p>

<p>The general naturalistic theory has been discussed in
Chapter XVIII. Here it is only necessary to point out
that it is a misreading of evolution to suppose unregulated
competition to be its highest category of progress,
and that it is a misinterpretation of ethics to assume
that might is right. With the dawn of higher forms of
life, co&ouml;peration and sympathy prove stronger forces
for progress than ruthless competition. The "struggle"
for any existence that has a claim to moral recognition
must be a struggle for more than physical existence or
survival of force. It must be a struggle for a <i>moral</i>
existence, an existence of rational and social beings on
terms of mutual sympathy and service as well as of full
individuality. Any claim for an economic process, if it
is to be a moral claim, must make its appeal on moral
grounds and to moral beings. If it recognizes only a
few as having worth, then it can appeal only to these.
These few have no moral right to complain if the many,
whom they do not recognize, refuse to recognize them.</p>

<p><b>Summary of the Ethics of Individualism.</b>&mdash;Individualism
provides well for production of quantity and kinds
required of goods and services; for activity and formal
freedom.  Under present conditions of organization and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
modern methods it cannot be made to serve a democratic
conception of justice, but inevitably passes over into a
struggle for pre&euml;minence, in which the strong and less
scrupulous will have the advantage. It can be treated
as just only if justice is defined as what is according
to contract (formal freedom); or if the welfare of certain
classes or individual members of society is regarded
as of subordinate importance; or, finally, if it is held
that this welfare is to be obtained only incidentally, as
gift, not directly through social action. The criticism on
individualism is then that under a collective system like
that of the present, it does scant justice to most individuals.
It leaves the many out from all active participation
in progress or morality.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

UNSETTLED PROBLEMS IN THE ECONOMIC
ORDER (<span class="smcap">Continued</span>)</h2>


<h4>&sect; 4. THE THEORY OF PUBLIC AGENCY AND CONTROL</h4>

<p>The various theories of public direction, including
socialism in the technical sense, are primarily interested
in the just distribution of goods. It is not so much "How
many goods can be produced?" as "Who is to get them?"
Individualism was chiefly concerned in increasing public
wealth, assuming (in the case of the democratic individualists)
that all would get the benefit. Socialism is more
concerned that the producing persons shall not be sacrificed,
and that each member shall benefit by the result.
Public agency and control might assert itself (1) as
a method of production, (2) as a method of distribution
of goods and returns, (3) as a method of property. It
is important to note at the outset that all civilized peoples
have some degree of social direction in each of these
fields. (1) Practically all peoples collect taxes, coin
money, carry mails, protect life and property, and supply
such elementary demands as those for water and drainage,
through State or municipal agency instead of leaving it
to private initiative. And in every one of the instances
the work was formerly done privately. (2) Under distribution,
all progressive peoples give education through the
State. Further, the benefits of the mail service are distributed
not in proportion to receipts, but on other principles
based on social welfare. (3) As a method of property-holding,
all civilized peoples hold certain goods for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
common use, and in the United States, after a period in
which it has been the policy to distribute for little or no
compensation public lands, public franchises, and public
goods of all kinds, the public policy is now not only to
retain large tracts for forest reserve, but to construct
irrigation plants, and to provide public parks, playgrounds,
and other forms of property to be used for
common advantage. Just as the individualist does not
necessarily carry his doctrine to the extreme of dispensing
with all social agency, at least in the matters of public
protection and public health, so the socialist does not
necessarily wish to abolish private property or private
enterprise. We have, then, to consider briefly the ethical
aspects of public agency for production, public control
over distribution, public holding of wealth.</p>


<h4>&sect; 5. SOCIETY AS AGENCY OF PRODUCTION</h4>

<p>The advantage claimed for society as an agent of
production is not primarily greater efficiency, although
it is claimed that the present method is enormously wasteful
except where there already is private monopoly. Nor is
it in the social service rendered by providing great variety
of goods, and of the kinds most wanted. It is rather
(1) that in the case of public service enterprises, such
as transportation or lighting, fairness to the various
shippers, localities, and other users can be secured only
through public control or operation. These services are
as indispensable to modern life as air or navigation. Only
by public agency can discrimination be avoided. (2)
That the prizes to be gained are here so enormous that
bribery and corruption are inevitable under private management.
(3) That the profits arising from the growth
of the community belong to the community, and can only
be secured if the community owns and operates such
agencies of public service as transportation, communi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>cation,
and in cities water supply and lighting. (4)
That the method of individualistic production is reckless
of child life and in general of the health of workmen.
Great Britain is already fearing a deterioration in
physical stature and capacity. (5) The motive of self-interest,
relied upon and fostered by individualism, is anti-social.
How can morality be expected to improve when
the fundamental agency and method of business and industry
is contradictory to morality? (6) More complete
socialism maintains that, under modern capitalism, a disproportionate
share is sure to fall to the capitalist, and,
more than this, to the great capitalist. Modern production
is complex and expensive. It requires an enormous
plant; the capitalist, not the workman, has the tools,
and can therefore charge what he pleases. The small
capitalist cannot undertake competition with the great
capitalist, for the latter can undersell him until he drives
him from business, and can then recoup himself by greater
gains. Hence the only way to secure fair distribution is
through social ownership of the tools and materials for
production.</p>

<p><b>Private Interests and Public Welfare.</b>&mdash;Touching
these points it may be said that the public conscience is
rapidly coming to a decision upon the first five. (1) The
public has been exploited, the officials of government
have been bribed, and individual members of society discriminated
against. The process of competition always
involves <i>v&aelig; victis</i>, but the particular factor which makes
this not only hard but unjust, is that in all these cases
we have a quasi-public agency (monopoly, franchise,
State-aided corporation) used to give private advantage.
This must be remedied either by public ownership or
public control, unless the ethics of the struggle for existence
is accepted. The corruption which has prevailed
under (2) must be met either by public ownership or control,
or by so reducing the value of such franchises as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
to leave "nothing in it" for the "grafter" and his co-operators.
Vice&mdash;gambling, excessive use of drugs and
liquors, prostitution&mdash;is no doubt injurious to its victims,
and when leagued with public officials and yielding
enormous corruption funds to debauch politics, it is a
public evil as well. But its victims are limited, and its
appearance not attractive to the great majority. The
exploitation and corruption practiced by the more generally
successful and "respectable" members of society,
is far more insidious and wide-reaching. It demoralizes
not individuals only, but the standards of society. As
to (3) there is no doubt as to the rights of the matter.
Gains due to social growth should be socially shared, not
appropriated by a few. The only question is as to the
best method of securing these gains. European States
and cities have gone much farther than the United States
along the line of public agency, and, while there is still
dispute as to the balance of advantage in certain cases,
there is a growing sentiment that the more intelligent
and upright the community, the more it can wisely undertake.
The moral principle is that the public must
have its due. Whether it pays certain agents a salary
as its own officials, or a commission in the form of a moderate
dividend, is not so important.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> But to pay a man
or a small group of promoters a million dollars to supply
water or lighting or transportation, seems no more moral
than to pay such a salary to a mayor or counsel or superintendent
of schools. Taxpayers would probably denounce
such salaries as robbery. Such franchises as have
for the most part been given in American cities have been
licenses to collect high taxes from the citizens for the
benefit of a few, and do not differ in principle from paying
excessive salaries, except as the element of risk enters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
What is needed at present in the United States is a larger
number of experiments in various methods of agency to
see which type results in least corruption, fairest distribution,
and best service.</p>

<p><b>Conditions of Labor.</b>&mdash;On the fourth point, the necessity
of public control to regulate child labor, the labor
of women, sanitary conditions, and the use of dangerous
machinery, the public conscience is also awakening. Decisions
of the courts on the constitutionality of regulating
women's labor have been somewhat at variance. But the
recently announced decision<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> of the United States Supreme
Court in the "Oregon case" seems likely to be decisive
of the principle that women may be treated as a class.
Freedom of contract cannot be regarded as interfering
with the right to establish reasonable precautions for
women's health. Woman may be protected "from the
greed as well as from the passion of man." The immorality
of child labor under modern conditions is also becoming
clear. For the public to see child life stunted
physically, mentally, and morally by premature labor
under the exhausting, deadening, and often demoralizing
conditions of modern industry and business, is for the
public to consent to wickedness. It cannot leave this
matter to the conscience of individual manufacturers and
parents, for the conscientious manufacturer is at a disadvantage,
and it might with as much morality consent to
a parent's starving or poisoning his child as to his injuring
it in less violent manner. For a society pretending to
be moral to permit little children to be used up or stunted
under any plea of cheap production or support of parents,
is not above the moral level of those peoples which practice
infanticide to prevent economic stress. Indeed, in
the case of a country which boasts of its wealth, there
is far less justification than for the savage. In the case
of provision against accident due to dangerous machinery,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
the ethical principle is also clear. To throw all the burden
of the accidents incident to modern production upon the
families of the laborers is entirely unjust. To impose
it upon the conscientious manufacturer is no better, for
it places him at a disadvantage. This is a necessary&mdash;except
so far as it can be minimized by safety devices&mdash;part
of the modern machine process. It ought to be paid
for either by all manufacturers, who would then shift
it to the consumers in the price of the goods, or by the
public as a whole in some form of insurance. European
countries have gone much farther than the United States
in this direction. The theory that the employer is exempt
if a fellow workman contributes in any way to the accident
has been applied in the United States in such a
way as to free employers, and thus the public, from any
share in the burden of a large part of accidents&mdash;except
as these entail poverty and bring the victim and his family
into the dependent class.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is only by public action that fair conditions
of labor can be secured in many trades and under
many employers. For the single workman has not the
slightest chance to make conditions, and the union has
no effective means to support its position unless it represents
a highly skilled trade and controls completely the
supply of labor. It may go without saying that violence
is wrong. But it is often ignored that for a <i>prosperous
society to leave the laborer no remedy but violence for
an intolerable condition is just as wrong</i>.</p>

<p><b>Motives.</b>&mdash;(5) On the question of motives the collectivist
theory is probably over-sanguine as to the gain to be
effected by external means. It is difficult to believe that
any change in methods would eliminate selfishness. There
is abundant exercise of selfishness in political democracy,
and even in families. Further, if it should be settled on
other grounds that competition in certain cases performs
a social service, it would then be possible for a man to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
compete with a desire to serve the public, just as truly
as it would be possible to compete for selfish motives.
That a process causes pain incidentally does not necessarily
pervert the motive of the surgeon or parent. It
does, of course, throw the burden of proof upon the advocate
of the process. Rivalry need not mean enmity if
the rivals are on an equal footing and play fair.</p>

<p><b>Exploitation of Labor.</b>&mdash;(6) The question whether all
capitalistic production first exploits the laboring class,
and then tends to absorb or drive out of business the small
capitalist, is not so easy of decision. It seems to be easy
to make a plausible statement for each side by statistical
evidence. There seems little doubt that the general standard
of living for laborers is rising. On the other hand,
the number of enormous fortunes seems to rise much
faster, and there is an appalling amount of poverty in
the great cities. This is sometimes attributed to thriftlessness
or to excessively large families. A careful study
of an English agricultural community, where the conditions
seemed at least as good as the average, showed that
a family could not have over two children without sinking
below the line of adequate food, shelter, and clothing, to
say nothing of medical attendance or other comforts. In
the United States there has been such a supply of land
available that the stress has not been so intense. Just
what the situation will be if the country becomes thickly
settled cannot be foretold. Professor J. B. Clark shows
that the tendency in a static society would be to give
the laborer more and more nearly his share&mdash;provided
there is free competition for his services. The difficulty
is that society is not static and that a laborer cannot
shift at will from trade to trade and from place to
place.</p>

<p>That sometimes capital exploits labor is merely to say
that the buyer sometimes gets the advantage. That capital
usually has the advantage in its greater resources may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
be admitted, but that it <i>invariably must</i> seems an unwarranted
deduction. The multiplication of wants widens
continually the number of occupations and thus increases
the competition for the service of the more skilled. In
such cases some, at least, of the sellers should be in a
position to make a fair bargain. Indeed, recent socialists
do not advocate any such complete assumption by society
of all production as is presented in some of the socialistic
Utopias. Their principle is "that the State must undertake
the production and distribution of social wealth wherever
private enterprise is dangerous or less efficient than
public enterprise."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>It is for those who do not believe in public control to
prove that in the great enterprises for the production of
the necessaries of life, for transportation, banking, mining,
and the like, private enterprise is not dangerous.
The conduct of many&mdash;not all&mdash;of these enterprises in
recent years, not only in their economic aspects, but in
their recklessness of human life, health, and morality, is
what makes socialism a practical question. If it is
adopted, it will not be for any academic or <i>a priori</i> reasons.
It will be because private enterprise fails to serve
the public, and its injustice becomes intolerable. If business
enterprise, as sometimes threatens, seeks to subordinate
political and social institutions, including legislatures
and courts, to economic interests, the choice must be between
public control and public ownership. And if,
whether by the inherent nature of legal doctrine and
procedure, or by the superior shrewdness of capital
in evading regulation, control is made to appear ineffective,
the social conscience will demand ownership. To
subordinate the State to commercial interests is as immoral
as to make the economic interest supreme in the
individual.</p>

<p>As regards the relations between capital and labor, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
argues an undeveloped state of society that we have no
machinery for determining controversy as to what is a
fair wage. In the long run, and on the whole, supply
and demand may give an approximately fair adjustment,
but our present method of fighting it out in doubtful
cases is barbaric. The issue is decided often by violence
or the no less unmoral motive of pressing want, instead
of by the moral test of what is fair. And the great third
interest, the consumer, or the public at large, is not represented
at all. New Zealand, Canada, and some of the
states in the United States have made beginnings. The
President undoubtedly commanded general support in his
position during the coal strike, when he maintained that
the public was morally bound to take some part in the
struggle.</p>

<p>Must not society be lacking in resources if its only
resource is to permit exploitation, on the one hand,
or carry on all industry and business itself, upon the
other? To lose the flexibility, variety, and keenness of
interest secured by individual or associated enterprise,
would certainly be an evil. Early business was conducted
largely by kinship organizations. The pendulum has
doubtless reached the other extreme in turning over to
groups, organized on a purely commercial basis, operations
that could be more equitably managed by city or
state agency. Most favor public agency in the case of
schools. Railroads, gas companies, and other monopolies
are still subject to controversy. But that an ideally
organized society should permit associations and grouping
of a great many kinds as agencies for carrying on its
work seems a platform not to be abandoned until proved
hopeless.</p>

<p><b>Collective Agency is Not Necessarily Social.</b>&mdash;The
socialist is inclined to think that if the agency of production
were the government or the whole organized society
this would give a genuine social agency of control.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
This by no means follows. Party government and city
government in the United States have shown the fallacy
of this. But even apart from the possibility of a corrupt
boss there is still a wide gap between the collective
and the socialized agency. For until the members of
society have reached a sufficiently high level of intelligence
and character to exercise voluntary control, and
to co&ouml;perate wisely and efficiently, there must be some
central directing agency. And such an agency will be
morally external to a large number. It doesn't matter
so much what name this agent is called by&mdash;i.e., whether
he is "capitalist," or "government,"&mdash;so long as the control
is external. In general, individuals are still without
the mutual confidence and public intelligence which
would enable them really to socialize the mechanically
collective process.</p>


<h4>&sect; 6. THEORIES OF JUST DISTRIBUTION</h4>

<p>Socialism as theory of distribution does not necessarily
imply public operation of production. By graded taxation
the proceeds of production might be taken by society
and either held, used, or distributed on some supposedly
more equitable basis. To give point to any inquiry as
to the justice of a proposed distribution, it would be desirable
to know what is the present distribution. Unfortunately,
no figures are accepted by all students. Spahr's
<i>Present Distribution of Wealth in the United States</i>
estimates that seven-eighths of the families in the United
States own only one-eighth of the wealth, and that one
per cent. own more than the remaining ninety-nine per
cent. This has been challenged, but any estimate made
by the economists shows such enormous disproportion as
to make it incredible that the present distribution can be
regarded as just on any definition of justice other than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>"according to the principles of contract and competition."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Suppose, then, the question is raised, How can</span><br />
we make a just distribution?</p>

<p><b>Criteria Proposed.</b>&mdash;The simplest, and at the same time
most mechanical and abstract, method would be to divide
all goods equally. This would be to ignore all moral and
other differences, as indeed is practically done in the suffrage.
If all men are accounted equal in the State, why
not in wealth? It may be admitted that, if society were
to distribute, it would have to do it on some system which
could be objectively administered. To divide wealth according
to merit, or according to efforts, or according
to needs, would be a far more moral method. But it is
difficult to see how, in the case of material goods or their
money equivalent, such a division could be made by any
being not omniscient as well as absolutely just. If we are
to consider distribution as administered by society, we
seem reduced to the alternative of the present system or a
system of equality.</p>

<p><b>1. The Individualistic Theory.</b>&mdash;It is indeed supposed
by some that the individualistic or competitive system distributes
on a moral basis: viz., according to merit. This
claim would have to meet the following criticisms:</p>

<p>(1) The first abstraction which this individualistic
principle of reward usually makes it that it gives a man
credit for all he achieves, or charges him with all his
failures, without recognizing the threefold origin of
these achievements or failures. Heredity, society, personal
choice, have each had some share in the result. But,
in considering the ethics of competition upon this maxim,
there is evidently no attempt to discriminate between
these several sources. The man born with industrial genius,
presented by society with the knowledge of all that
has been done in the past, and equipped by society with
all the methods and tools society can devise, certainly has
an advantage over the man of moderate talents and no
education. To claim that the first should be justly re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>warded
for his superiority would imply that the reception
of one gift constitutes a just claim for another.</p>

<p>(2) Secondly, the theory as applied to our present system
is guilty of a further abstraction in assuming that
the chief, if not the only, way to deserve reward is by individualistic
shrewdness and energy.</p>

<p>(3) It measures desert by service rendered without taking
any account of motive or even of intent. The captain
of industry performs an important service to society;
therefore, it is argued, he should be rewarded accordingly,
quite irrespective of the question whether he was aiming
at social welfare or at selfish gain. It may even be plausibly
argued that to reward men financially for good motives
would be bribing men to be honest. It is true that
financial rewards will not make good citizens, but this is
irrelevant. The point is that whatever other reasons,&mdash;expediency,
difficulty of estimating intent and motive,&mdash;may
be urged for abstracting from everything but the
result, the one reason which cannot be urged is, such abstraction
is just. A person has rights only because he is
a social person. But to call a man a social person because
he incidentally produces useful results, is to say that
purpose and will are negligible elements of personality.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p><b>2. Equal Division.</b>&mdash;The system of equal division is
liable to the following criticism. In their economic services
men are not equal. They are unequal not merely in talent
and ability; not merely in the value of their work; they
are unequal in their disposition. To treat idle and industrious,
useless and useful, slow and quick alike is not
equality, but inequality. It is to be guilty of as palpable
an abstraction as to say that all men are equally free
because they are not subject to physical constraint. Real
equality will try to treat like conditions alike, and unlike
character, efforts, or services differently.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, a psychological objection which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
would weigh against an equal division even if such were
regarded as just. The average man perhaps prefers an
economic order in which there are prizes and blanks to an
order in which every man draws out the same. He prefers
an exciting game to a sure but tame return of his
investment. He may call for a "square deal," but we
must remember that a "square deal" in the great American
game from which the metaphor is taken is not designed to
make the game less one of chance. It is designed to give
full scope to luck and nerve. A game in which every
player was sure to win, but also sure to win just what he
had put in, would be equitable, but it would not be a game.
An equal distribution might rob life of its excitement and
its passion. Possibly the very strain of the process develops
some elements of character which it would be unfortunate
to lose.</p>

<p>Is there no alternative possible for society except an
equality which is external only, and therefore unequal,
or an inequality which charges a man with all the accrued
benefits or evils of his ancestry? Must we either recognize
no moral differences in men, or else be more merciless than
the old orthodox doctrine of hereditary or imputed guilt?
The theological doctrine merely made a man suffer for
his ancestors' sins; the doctrine of unlimited individualism
would damn him not only for his ancestors' sins and
defects, but for the injustice suffered by his ancestors at
the hands of others. The analysis of the sources of a
man's ability may give a clue to a third possibility, and
it is along this line that the social conscience of to-day is
feeling its way.</p>

<p><b>3. A Working Programme.</b>&mdash;A man's power is due (1)
to physical heredity; (2) to social heredity, including care,
education, and the stock of inventions, information, and
institutions which enables him to be more efficient than
the savage; and finally (3) to his own efforts. Individualism
may properly claim this third factor. It is just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
to treat men unequally so far as their efforts are unequal.
It is socially desirable to give as much incentive
as possible to the full development of every one's powers.
But the <i>very same reason demands that in the first two
respects we treat men as equally as possible</i>. For it
is for the good of the social body to get the most
out of its members, and it can get the most out of
them only by giving them the best start possible. In
physical heredity the greater part is, as yet, wholly
outside control, but there is an important factor which
is in the sphere of moral action, namely, the physical
condition of the parents, particularly of the mother. Conditions
of food, labor, and housing should be such that
every child may be physically well born. In the various
elements included under social heredity society has a freer
hand. Not a <i>free</i> hand, for physical and mental incapacity
limit the amount of social accumulation which can
be communicated, but we are only beginning to appreciate
how much of the deficiency formerly acquiesced in as hopeless
may be prevented or remedied by proper food, hygiene,
and medical care. <i>Completely</i> equal education, likewise,
cannot be given; not in kind, for not all children have like
interests and society does not want to train all for the
same task; nor in quantity, for some will have neither the
ability nor the disposition to do the more advanced work.
But as, little by little, labor becomes in larger degree
scientific, the ratio of opportunities for better trained
men will increase, and as education becomes less exclusively
academic, and more an active preparation for all kinds
of work, the interests of larger and larger numbers of
children will be awakened. Such a programme as this is
one of the meanings of the phrase "<i>equal opportunity</i>,"
which voices the demand widely felt for some larger conception
of economic and social justice than now obtains.
It would make formal freedom, formal "equality" before
the law, less an empty mockery by giving to every child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
some of the power and knowledge which are the necessary
conditions of real freedom.</p>

<p>Society has already gone a long way along the line of
giving an equal share in education. It is moving rapidly
toward broader conceptions of education for all occupations&mdash;farming,
mechanics, arts, trade, business&mdash;as well
as for the "learned professions." It is making a beginning
toward giving children (see the Report of the New
York Tenement House Commission) a chance to be born
and grow up with at least a living minimum of light and
air. Libraries and dispensaries and public health officials
are bringing the science and literature of the world in
increasing measure into the lives of all. When by the better
organization of the courts the poor man has real, and
not merely formal equality before the law, and thereby
justice itself is made more accessible to all, another long
step will be taken toward a juster order. How far society
can go is yet to be solved. But is it not at least a working
hypothesis for experiment, that society should try to
give to all its members the gains due to the social progress
of the past? How far the maxim of equal opportunity
will logically lead it is impossible to say. Fortunately,
the moral problem is to work out new ideals, not merely to
administer old ones. Other possibilities of larger justice
are noticed under &sect; 8 below.</p>


<h4>&sect; 7. OWNERSHIP AND USE OF PROPERTY</h4>

<p>The public wealth may be controlled and used in four
ways: It may be (1) Privately owned and used; (2) Privately
owned and publicly used; (3) Publicly held, but privately
used; (4) Publicly held and commonly used. The
individualist would have all wealth, or as much as possible,
under one of the first two forms. The tendency in the
United States until very recently has been to divest the
public of all ownership. The socialist, while favoring pri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>vate
ownership and use of the more strictly personal articles,
favors the public holding of much which is now privately
owned&mdash;notably the land, or the instruments of
production&mdash;as versus the holding of these by private or
corporate persons. Or, again, it may be maintained that
while individuals should be allowed to accumulate as much
property as they can, they should not be allowed to transmit
it entirely to their heirs.</p>

<p><b>Value of Private Property.</b>&mdash;The individualist may
properly point to the psychological and historical significance
of private property, which has been stated in
a preceding chapter (p. 490). He may say that the
evils there mentioned as attendant upon private property
do not belong to the property in itself, but to the exaggerated
love of it. He may admit that the present emphasis
of attention upon the ownership of wealth, rather than
upon intellectual or &aelig;sthetic or social interests, is not the
highest type of human endeavor. But he urges that the
positive values of property are such that the present policy
of placing no check upon property should be maintained.
In addition to the indirect social value through
the power and freedom given to its owners, it may be
claimed that the countless educational, charitable, and
philanthropic agencies sustained by voluntary gifts from
private property, are both the best method of accomplishing
certain socially valuable work, and have an important
reflex value in promoting the active social interest of those
who carry them on. Nor is the force of this entirely
broken by the counter claim that this would justify keeping
half the population in poverty in order to give the
other half the satisfaction of charity. No system short of
absolute communism can abolish the need of friendly
help.</p>

<p><b>Defects and Dangers in the Present System.</b>&mdash;The first
question which arises is: If property is so valuable morally,
how many are profiting by it under the present system,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
and how many are without its beneficent effects? Is the
number of property-owners increasing or diminishing? In
one of the morally most valuable forms of property, the
number of those who profit is certainly decreasing relatively:
<i>viz.</i>, in the owning of homes. The building of private
residences has practically ceased in New York and many
other cities except for the very rich. With the increasing
value of land the owning of homes is bound to become more
and more rare. Only the large capitalist can put up the
apartment house. In the ownership of shops and industries
the number of owners has relatively decreased, that
of clerks has increased. The wage-workers in cities
are largely propertyless. The management of industries
through corporations while theoretically affording opportunity
for property has yet, as Judge Grosscup has
pointed out forcibly, been such as to discourage the small
investor, and to prompt to the consumption of wages as
fast as received. The objection to individualism on this
ground would then be as before, that it is not individual
enough.</p>

<p>An objection of contrary character is that the possession
of property releases its owner from any necessity of
active effort or service to the public. It may therefore
injure character on both its individual and its social side.
Probably the absolute number of those who refrain from
any social service because of their property is not very
large, and it may be questioned whether the particular
persons would be socially very valuable under any system
if they are now oblivious to all the moral arguments for
such activity and service.</p>

<p>A more serious objection to the individualistic policy
is the enormous power allowed to the holders of great properties.
It has been estimated that a trust fund recently
created for two grandchildren will exceed five billion dollars
when handed over. It is easily possible that some of
the private fortunes now held may, if undisturbed, amount<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
to far more than the above within another generation.
Moreover, the power of such a fortune is not limited to its
own absolute purchasing value. By the presence of its
owners upon directorates of industrial, transportation,
banking, and insurance corporations the resources of
many other owners are controlled. A pressure may be
exerted upon political affairs compared with which actual
contributions to campaign funds are of slight importance.
The older theory in America was that the injury to the
private character of the owners of wealth would negative
the possible dangers to the public, since possession of large
wealth would lead to relaxation of energy, or even to dissipation.
It was assumed that the father acquired the fortune,
the son spent it, and thus scattered it among the
many, and the grandson began again at the bottom of the
ladder. Now that this theory is no longer tenable, society
will be obliged to ask how much power may safely be left
to any individual.</p>

<p>It must be recognized that the present management of
such natural resources as forests under the r&eacute;gime of private
property has been extremely wasteful and threatens
serious injury to the United States. Individual owners
cannot be expected to consider the welfare of the country
at large, or of future generations; hence the water power
is impaired and the timber supply of the future threatened.</p>

<p>Finally it must be remembered that many of the present
evils and inequities in ownership are not due necessarily
to a system of private property, but rather to special
privileges possessed by classes of individuals. These may
be survivals of past conquests of arms as in Europe, or
derived by special legislation, or due to a perfectly unconscious
attitude of public morals which carries over to a
new situation the customs of an early day. Mill's famous
indictment of present conditions is not in all respects so
applicable to America as to the older countries of Europe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
but it has too much truth to be omitted in any ethical consideration.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If the choice were to be made between communism with
all its chances, and the present state of society with all its
sufferings and injustices, if the institution of private property
necessarily carried with it, as a consequence, that the produce
of labor should be apportioned as we now see it, almost in an
inverse ratio to the labor,&mdash;the largest portions to those
who have not worked at all, the next largest to those whose
work is almost nominal, and so in descending scale, the
remuneration dwindling as the work grows harder and more
disagreeable, until the most fatiguing and exhausting bodily
labor cannot count with certainty on being able to earn even
the necessaries of life,&mdash;if this, or communism, were the alternative,
all the difficulties, great or small, of communism
would be but as dust in the balance. But to make the comparison
applicable, we must compare communism at its best
with the r&eacute;gime of individual property, not as it is, but as it
might be made. The principle of private property has never
yet had a fair trial in any country." (<i>Polit. Econ.</i>, Book II.,
ch. i.)</p></div>


<h4>&sect; 8. PRESENT TENDENCIES</h4>

<p><b>Individualistic Foundations.</b>&mdash;The general tendency
up to very recent time in the United States has been decidedly
individualistic, both in the policy concerning the
method of holding property, and in the legal balance between
vested property rights and the social welfare. Public
lands were granted on easy terms to homesteaders;
mines as well as soil were practically free to the prospector;
school fund lands were in most cases sold for a song instead
of being kept for the public. So general has been
the attitude that all wealth ought to be in private hands
that it has been difficult to convict men who have fraudulently
obtained vast tracts of public land. The magnitude
of the operation has given "respectability" to the
beneficiaries. The taxing power has done little to maintain
adjustment. In this, as in many other respects, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
policy of the United States has been far more individualistic
than that of Great Britain. The latter has graded
income and inheritance taxes. In the United States, on
the other hand, the Federal taxation bears more heavily on
the poor as they are the large body of consumers,&mdash;not,
of course, in the sense that the individual poor man pays
more than the individual rich man, but in the sense that
a million of dollars owned by a thousand men pays more
than a million owned by one man. Legally, the Constitution
of the United States and certain of its amendments
gave private rights extraordinary protection, especially
when contracts were construed to mean charters, as well
as private contracts. The public welfare was conceived
to reside almost solely in private rights.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p><b>Increased Recognition of Public Welfare.</b>&mdash;Recent policy
and legal decisions show a decided change. Reserves
of forest lands have been established. Water-supplies,
parks, and many other kinds of property have been
changed from private to public ownership. The question
as to mines has been raised. Graded inheritance taxes
have been established in some states, and the question of
graded income taxes is likely to be more generally considered
unless some other form of taxation based on the
social values given to land, or franchises, or other forms
of property seems more equitable. The Supreme Court in
recent decisions "has read into the constitution two sweeping
exceptions to the inviolability of property rights."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
One is that of public use. "Whenever the owner of a
property devotes it to a use in which the public has an
interest, he in effect grants to the public an interest in such
use, and must to the extent of that use submit to be controlled
by the public for the common good so long as he
maintains the use." The second exception is that of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
police power which in 1906 (204 U. S., 311, 318) was declared
to extend "to so dealing with the conditions which
exist in the state as to bring out of them the greatest welfare
of its people." The application of this broad principle
is still in an uncertain condition, but there can be no
question that it recognizes a changed situation. When people
are living in such interdependence as in the collective
life of to-day, it is no longer possible to locate public welfare
in any such preponderating degree in private rights
as was justified under the conditions of a new country a
century ago. Says Professor Smith:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On the fundamental question of the relation of public
policy to private property rights the [Supreme] Court has
abandoned the individualist views with which the founders
of the constitution were imbued; and in its doctrines of the
public use and the police power it has distinctly accepted what
may be termed, in the literal and proper sense of the word,
the socialist view. In so doing, it has unquestionably expressed
the dominant opinion of the American people. The
American people does not accept the collectivist theory; it
believes in private property; but it recognizes that rights
of property must yield, in cases of conflict, to the superior
rights of society at large."</p></div>

<p>If some of the means set forth above for securing juster
distribution were adopted, the first step toward Mill's demand<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
would be met. If the community should reap the
return for its own growth, if taxation should be so arranged
as to fall most heavily on those best able to pay
rather than on those who are most honest or least able
to evade, it would seem rational to hold that society will
find a way to continue the four forms of control now existing,
making such shifts as changing conditions require.</p>

<p>Some of these shiftings are already evident and give
promise of greater justice without loss of any of the benefits
accruing from private property.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Social Justice through Economic, Social, and Scientific
Progress.</b>&mdash;Not all moral advance comes "with observation,"
or by political agency. The economic process is
providing in certain lines a substitute for property.
Science and invention, which are themselves a fine illustration
of the balance and interaction between individual and
social intelligence, individual effort and social co&ouml;peration,
are making possible in many ways a state of society in
which men have at once greater freedom and greater power
through association, greater individual development and
greater socialization of interests, less private property but
greater private use and enjoyment of what is common.</p>

<p>The substitute for property provided by the economic
process itself is permanence or security of support. If
the person can count definitely upon a future, this is equivalent
to the security of property. And through the organization
of modern industry supplemented by insurance
and pensions, either state, institutional, or in corporations,
or in mutual benefit associations, there has been on the
whole, a great increase of security, although it is still unfortunately
true that the wage-worker may in most cases
be dismissed at any moment, and has virtually no contract,
or even any well-assured confidence of continued
employment.</p>

<p>It is a mutual co&ouml;peration of economic, social, and scientific
factors which has brought about a great increase
of individual use and enjoyment through public ownership.
This <i>has placed many of the things which make life
worth living within the enjoyment of all</i>, and at the same
time given a far better service to the users than the old
method of private ownership. <i>In this change lies, perhaps,
the greatest advance of justice</i> in the economic sphere, and
a great promise for the future. There was a time when
if a man would sit down on a piece of ground and enjoy a
fine landscape, he must own it. If he would have a plot
where his children might play, he must own it. If he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
travel, he must carry his own lantern, and furnish his
own protection from thieves. If he would have water, he
must sink his own well. If he would send a letter, he must
own or hire a messenger. If he would read a book, he must
not merely own the book, but own or hire the author or
copyist. If he would educate his children, he must own
or hire the tutor. We have learned that public parks,
public lighting and water works, public libraries, and
public schools, are better than private provision.</p>

<p>The objection which comes from the individualist to this
programme is that it does too much for the individual. It
is better, urges individualism, to stimulate the individual's
activity and leave his wants largely unsatisfied than to
satisfy all his wants at the expense of his activity. But
this assumes that what is done through public agencies is
done for the people and not by the people. A democracy
may do for itself what an aristocracy may not do for a
dependent class. The greatest demoralization at the present
time is not to those who have not, but to those who
appropriate gains due to associated activity, complacently
supposing that they have themselves created all that they
enjoy.</p>

<p><b>Another Great Advance is the Change in What Makes
Up the Chief Values of Life.</b>&mdash;In early times the values
of life were largely found in food, clothing, personal ornaments,
bodily comfort, sex gratifications. Enjoyment
of these involved exclusive possession and therefore property.
But with the advance of civilization an increasing
proportion of life's values falls in the mental realm of
sharable goods.</p>

<p>Satisfaction in knowledge, in art, in association, in freedom,
is not diminished, but increased when it is shared.
The educated man may have no more property than the
illiterate. He has access to a whole system of social values.
He has freedom; he has a more genuinely independent type
of power than accrues from the mere possession of things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
The society of the future will find a part of its justice in
so adjusting its economic system that all may enter as
fully as possible into this more social world.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Social Selection.</b>&mdash;Finally, recognizing all
the value of the competitive process in the past as a
method of selecting ability, it must be regarded as crude
and wasteful. It is like the method of blind trial and
error which obtains in the animal world. The method
of ideas, of conscious use of means to secure ends, is the
more effective and the more rational. Society now is
gaining the scientific equipment which may allow the
substitution of the more effective and less wasteful method.
It should discover and educate capacity instead of giving
merely a precarious encouragement to certain special
types.</p>


<h4>&sect; 9. THREE SPECIAL PROBLEMS</h4>

<p>Three special problems may be noticed about which
moral judgment is as yet uncertain: The open versus the
closed shop, the capitalization of corporations, and the
"unearned increment."</p>

<p><b>1. The Open versus the Closed Shop.</b>&mdash;In certain industries
in which the workmen are well organized they
have made contracts with employers which provide that
only union men shall be employed. Such a shop is called
a closed shop, in distinction from an "open shop" in which
non-union men may be employed in part or altogether.
The psychological motive for the demand for the closed
shop is natural enough: the union has succeeded in gaining
certain advantages in hours or wages or both; this has
required some expense and perhaps some risk. It is natural
to feel that those who get the advantage should share
the expense and effort, and failing this, should not be admitted
to the shop. If the argument stopped here it would
be insufficient for a moral justification for two reasons.
First, joining a union involves much more than payment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
of dues. It means control by the union in ways which may
interfere with obligations to family, or even to the social
order. Hence, to exclude a fellow workman from the opportunity
to work because he&mdash;perhaps for conscientious
reasons&mdash;would not belong to the union, could not be justified
unless the union could make it appear that it was
maintaining a social and not merely a group interest.
Second, in some cases unions have sought to limit output.
In so far as this is done not for reasons of health but to
raise prices, the union is opposing the interest of consumers.
Here again the union must exhibit a social justification
if it is to gain social approval.</p>

<p>On the other hand it may be noted that the individualist
of the second sort&mdash;who believes in the competitive
struggle as a moral process&mdash;has no ground on which to
declare for "open shop." Exactly the same principle
which would permit combination in capital and place no
limit on competitive pressure, provided it is all done
through free contracts, can raise no objection against
combinations of laborers making the best contracts possible.
When a syndicate of capitalists has made a highly
favorable contract or successfully underwritten a large
issue of stock, it is not customary under the principle of
"open shop" to give a share in the contract to all who
ask for it, or to let the whole public in "on the ground
floor." Nor are capitalists accustomed to leave a part
of the market to be supplied by some competitor for fear
such competitor may suffer if he does not have business.
When the capitalist argues for the open shop upon the
ground of freedom and democracy, it seems like the case
of the mote and the beam.</p>

<p>An analogy with a political problem may aid: Has a
nation the right to exclude (or tax heavily) goods or persons
from other countries? May it maintain a "closed
shop"? The policy of the American colonists and of the
United States has varied.  The Puritans maintained a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
"closed shop" on religious lines. They came to this country
to maintain a certain religion and polity. They expelled
several men who did not agree with them. The
United States excludes Chinese laborers, and imposes a
tariff which in many cases is intended to be prohibitive
against the products of other countries. This is done
avowedly to protect the laborer, and in so far as it is effective
it closes the shop. The maxim "This is a white man's
country" is a similar "closed shop" utterance. On moral
grounds the non-union man is in the same category as the
man of alien race or country. What, if anything, can
justify a nation or smaller group from excluding others
from its benefits? Clearly the only conditions are (1)
that the group or nation is existing for some morally
justifiable end, which (2) would be endangered by the admission
of the outsiders. A colony established to work
out religious or political liberty would be justified in
excluding a multitude who sought to enter it and then subvert
these principles. If a union is working for a morally
valuable end, e.g., a certain standard of living which is
morally desirable, and if this were threatened by the admission
of non-union men, the closed shop would seem to
be justified. If the purpose were merely to secure certain
advantages to a small group, and if the open shop would
not lower the standard but merely extend its range of
benefits, it is hard to see why the closed shop is not a
selfish principle&mdash;though no more selfish than the grounds
on which the tariff is usually advocated.</p>

<p><b>2. The Capitalization of Corporations</b>, especially of
public service corporations, is a matter on which there
is a difference of policy in different states, owing probably
to uncertainty as to the morality of the principles involved.
The two theories held are: (a) Companies should
issue capital stock only on the basis of money paid in;
dividends then represent a return on actual investment.
(b) Companies may issue whatever stock they please, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
whatever they expect their income will enable them to pay
dividends upon; dividends will then represent return for
valuable privileges, or for some utility to be marketed.
In behalf of this latter view it may be claimed that if the
company pays dividends the investors have nothing to
complain of, and if it sells its products or transportation
at market rates, the consumer has nothing to complain of.</p>

<p>So far as the relations between corporation and investor
are concerned, the issues are simple. If the stocks are
issued with no expectation that they will give any return,
merely to "sell," it is pure dishonesty, of the same type
which under cruder conditions sold spavined horses or made
counterfeit money, and now assumes the more vulgar type
of dealing in "green goods." The fact that fictitious
capital can be publicly advertised, gives it a financial
but not a moral advantage. This, however, would have
such decided limitations, credulous as human nature is,
that if fictitious capital paid no dividends it would soon
have no market. Hence, for the far-seeing promoter,
the pressure is toward making some at least of the fictitious
capital pay dividends. What is the principle in
this case? If we are dealing with a new and untried mode
of production or public service, the case is simply that
of any speculation. If a proposed product has a possible
utility, but at the same time involves so much risk
that in the long run only half of such enterprises will
succeed, society may consider it worth offering a profit
equal to fifty per cent. in order to pay for the risk. If,
on the other hand, the income is to derive from valuable
public franchises, or from the growth of the community
and its necessities, the case is different. Here there is
little, if any, risk for which it is fair for society to pay.
The excessive capital beyond the cost is designed to disguise
the rate of profit, and therefore conceal from the
community the cost of the goods or service. If the public
demands cheaper rates it is told that the company is now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
paying only a fair dividend upon its stock.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The usual
method of capitalizing many enterprises of a quasi-public
sort is to issue bonds to cover the cost of construction
or plant, and then one or more series of stocks which
are known as "velvet." In part these stocks may represent
a work of organization which is a legitimate public
service, but in many cases they represent devices for
transferring public wealth to private property. Enormous
sums have been taken from the public in this
manner. The element which makes this method particularly
obnoxious is that the quasi-public corporations are
given a monopoly by the community and then take advantage
of this to capitalize indefinitely the necessities of
a growing community. In this case the conception of
public service is lost sight of in the "dazzling possibility
of public exploitation."<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>Few methods of extorting wealth have equaled this.
In some cases bribery of public officials has added an item
of expense to be collected later from the public. When
the various forms of public service or protected industry
were first projected there was risk involved. It was necessary
to offer inducements to capital to engage in them.
It was desirable to have railroads, gas, water, express
service. But as the factor of risk has been eliminated, the
public tires of paying double prices, and a "fair" return
must be estimated on the basis of actual rather than
fictitious capital. The public has come to have a clear
idea as to the morality of such practices as have been
employed in letting contracts for public buildings at
prices far above market value. The New York City courthouse
and Pennsylvania capitol offer familiar examples.
Does it differ materially from such practices when a com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>pany
charges the public an excessive price for transportation
or lighting, and when State or municipal authorities
authorize by franchise or monopoly such excessive
charges? Probably the conscience of the next century,
if not of the next generation, will fail to see the superior
moral quality of the latter procedure.</p>

<p><b>3. The "Unearned Increment."</b>&mdash;This term is applied
most frequently to the increase in land value or franchise
value which is due, not to the owner, but to the growth
of the community. A tract of land is bought at a price
fixed by its value as farm land. A city grows up. The
owner of the land may have been active in the building
up of industry, but he may not. An increase of values
follows, which is due to the growth of the community.
Shall the owner have it all, or shall the community have
it all, or shall there be a division? The growth in value
of a franchise for gas, electric lighting, transportation,
presents the same problem. It is not usually recognized,
however, that the same principle is found in every increase
of value due to increasing demand. The logical
basis for distinction would seem to be that in some cases
increase of demand calls out competition, and the price is
lowered; the public thus receives its share in lower cost.
In other cases, notably those first mentioned, there can
be no competition, the price is therefore not often lowered
unless by legislative action, and the whole benefit goes
to the owner of land or franchise. As regards land, the
case is much stronger in Europe, for land titles were
originally gained there largely by seizure, whereas
in America private titles have been largely through
purchase.</p>

<p>Individualism, according as it argues from the platform
of natural rights or from that of social welfare, would
claim either that individuals should have all the increase
because they have a right to all they can get under a
system of free contracts, or that it is for the social wel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>fare
to allow them all they can get since private property
is public wealth. From the standpoint of natural rights
the reply would seem to be unanswerable: the community
gives the increased value; it belongs to the community.
From the standpoint of social welfare the answer is not
so simple. It might, for example, be socially desirable to
encourage the owners of farming land by leaving to them
the increase in value due to the growth of the country,
whereas city land-owners might need no such inducement.
Investors in a new form of public service corporation
might need greater inducements than would be fair to
those in enterprises well established. But, although details
are complex, the social conscience is working toward
this general principle: the community should share in
the values which it produces. If it cannot do this by
cheaper goods and better service, it must by graded taxation,
by ownership, or by some other means. The British
government has already considered a measure for ascertaining
the land values in Scotland as a preliminary step
toward adjustment of this question.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX TO CHAPTER XXV</h3>


<h4>PROFESSOR SEAGER'S PROGRAMME OF SOCIAL LEGISLATION<br />
WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO WAGE-EARNERS</h4>


<p>In the conviction that in the field of social legislation
the United States is behind the more progressive countries
of Europe, Professor Henry R. Seager, of Columbia University,
presented the following <i>Outline</i> for discussion at
a meeting of the American Association for Labor Legislation,
December 30, 1907. It is reproduced with his
consent as giving concrete expression to several of the
principles advocated in the foregoing chapters.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The ends to be aimed at in any programme of social legislation
are:</p>

<p>I.  To protect wage-earners in the continued enjoyment of
standards of living to which they are already accustomed.</p>

<p>II.  To assist them to attain to higher standards of living.</p>


<p><i>I. Measures to protect prevailing standards of living.</i></p>

<p>The principal contingencies which threaten standards of
living already acquired are: (1) industrial accidents; (2) illness;
(3) invalidity and old age; (4) premature death; (5)
unemployment. These contingencies are not in practice adequately
provided against by wage-earners themselves. In
consequence the losses they entail, in the absence of any social
provision against them, fall with crushing force on the families
which suffer from them, and only too often reduce such families
from a position of independence and self-respect to one of
humiliating and efficiency-destroying social dependency. The
following remedies for the evils resulting from this situation
are suggested.</p>

<p>(1) Employers' liability laws fail to provide adequate indemnity
to the victims of industrial accidents because in a large
proportion of cases no legal blame attaches to the employer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
and because litigation under them is costly and uncertain in
its outcome. Adequate indemnification must be sought along
the line of workmen's compensation for all industrial accidents
at the expense of the employer (the British system) or of
compulsory accident insurance (the German system). The
former seems to accord better with American ideas and
traditions.</p>

<p>(2) The principle of workmen's compensation may be extended
to include indemnity for loss of wages due to trade
diseases. Provision against illness not directly traceable to
the employment must be sought either in compulsory illness
insurance or in subsidized and state-directed sick-insurance
clubs. Trade unions may assume the functions of such clubs
in organized trades. The latter plan seems better suited to
present American conditions than compulsory illness insurance.</p>

<p>(3) Provision against invalidity and old age may be through
compulsory old age insurance, or through state old age pensions.
The latter, though more costly, are believed to be better
suited to American conditions, when hedged about by proper
restrictions, than compulsory old age insurance with the elaborate
administrative machinery which it entails.</p>

<p>(4) Premature death may be provided against by an extension
of the machinery for caring for the victims of industrial
accident and of illness to provide for their families when accident
or illness results fatally.</p>

<p>(5) Provision against losses due to unemployment is attended
with great difficulties because unemployment is so frequently
the consequence of incapacity or of disinclination for
continuous labor. The most promising plan for providing
against this evil appears to be through subsidizing and supervising
trade unions which pay out-of-work benefits to stimulate
this side of their activity. Public employment bureaus and
industrial colonies for the unemployed may also help to
alleviate the evil of unemployment.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Adequate social provision against these five contingencies
along the lines suggested, would, it is believed, go a long way
towards solving the problem of social dependency. If these
concessions were made to the demands of social justice, a more
drastic policy towards social dependents than public opinion
will now sanction might be inaugurated with good prospect of
confining social dependency to the physically, mentally, and
morally defective.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span></p>

<p><i>II. Measures to elevate standards of living.</i></p>

<p>The primary conditions essential to rising standards of living
are energy and enterprise on the part of wage-earners and
opportunities to make energy and enterprise count in the form
of higher earnings. The principal contributions which social
legislation may make to advancing standards of living in the
United States are believed to be: (1) measures serving to encourage
saving for future needs on the part of wage-earners
by providing safe investments for savings; (2) measures protecting
wage-earners from the debilitating effects of an unregulated
competition; (3) measures serving to bring within
the reach of all opportunities for industrial training. Standards
of living will also be advanced, of course, by nearly all
measures calculated to promote the general well-being, such as
tax and tariff-reform legislation, laws safeguarding the national
domain, the public regulation of corporations, especially
those with monopolistic powers, etc., but these are not usually
classed under the head of social legislation.</p>

<p>(1) The greatest present need under this head is for a postal
savings bank like those of European countries. The advantages
of a postal savings bank over privately managed banks
are the wider distribution of places of deposit, post-offices being
located in every section of the country, and the greater confidence
depositors would feel in such a bank. Once established
the postal savings bank might enter the insurance field, as has
the British postal savings bank, not as a rival of privately
managed insurance companies, but to bring to every wage-earner
the opportunity to secure safe insurance. Next to
providing itself opportunities for safe investment and insurance,
the government has an important duty to perform in
supervising the business of privately managed savings banks
and insurance companies. Notwithstanding the progress made
in recent years in the United States in this field, there is still
something left for social legislation to accomplish.</p>

<p>(2) If energy and enterprise are to be kept at a maximum,
wage-earners must be protected from exhausting toil under
unhealthful conditions. Skilled wage-earners can usually protect
themselves through trade unions, but unskilled workers,
women and children, require legal protection. Under this head
belong, therefore, the familiar types of protective labor laws.
The following may be specified:</p>

<p>(a) Laws prohibiting the employment of children below<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
fourteen in all gainful pursuits. Such laws should be uniform
throughout the United States and rigidly enforced by means of
employment certificates based on convincing evidence of age
and physical examination to determine fitness. As provision
for free public education is made more adequate to present
needs the minimum age may be advanced perhaps to sixteen.</p>

<p>(b) Laws limiting the hours of labor of young persons over
fourteen. Protection here should extend to eighteen, at least
in factory employments, and employment certificates should
be required of all under that age.</p>

<p>(c) Laws limiting the hours of labor of women. In the
regulation of women's work in the United States the principal
needs are uniformity and machinery for efficient enforcement.
The last is facilitated by the plan of specifying in the law the
working period for the protected classes, and American courts
must be brought to see the reasonableness (administratively)
of such prescriptions. The nine-hour day and prohibition of
night work set a high enough standard until greater uniformity
and more efficient enforcement shall have been secured.</p>

<p>(d) Prescriptions in regard to sanitation and safety appliances.
General prescriptions in regard to ventilation, etc.,
need to be made more exact, and much more attention needs to
be given to the special regulation of dangerous trades, the
existence of which has been largely ignored thus far in American
legislation.</p>

<p>(3) The chief reason for restricting the labor of children
and young persons is to permit the physical and mental development
of childhood and youth to proceed unhampered and
to ripen into strong, vigorous, and efficient manhood and
womanhood. To attain this end, it is necessary to provide not
only for wholesome living conditions and general free public
education, but also for special industrial training for older
children superior to the training afforded in modern factories
and workshops. The apprenticeship system now fails as a
method of industrial training, even in those few trades which
retain the forms of apprenticeship. There is urgent social
need for comprehensive provision for industrial training as a
part of the public school system, not to take the place of the
training now given to children under fourteen, but to hold those
between fourteen and sixteen in school. As this need is
supplied the period of compulsory school attendance may
gradually be extended up to the sixteenth year. The guiding
principle of such industrial training should be that it is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
function of free public education in the United States not only
to prepare children to lead useful, well-rounded and happy
lives, but to command the earnings without which such lives are
impossible.</p>

<p>The above programme of social legislation is urged as a step
towards realizing that canon of social justice which demands
for all equal industrial opportunities. It is believed that it will
also help to raise the standard of citizenship in the country by
making both wage-earners and employers more intelligent,
more efficient, and more truly democratic. Thus it will serve
to prepare the way for such further industrial reorganization
as may be found desirable.</p></div>

<br /><br />

THE FAMILY</h2>


<p>The family in its moral aspects has one end, the common
good of all its members, but this has three aspects.
(1) Marriage converts an attachment between man and
woman, either of passion or of friendship, into a deliberate,
intimate, permanent, responsible union for a common
end of mutual good. It is this common end, a good
of a higher, broader, fuller sort than either could attain
in isolation, which lifts passion from the impulsive or
selfish to the moral plane; it is the peculiar intimacy
and the peculiar demands for common sympathy and co-operation,
which give it greater depth and reach than
ordinary friendship. (2) The family is the great social
agency for the care and training of the race. (3) This
function reacts upon the character of the parents. Tenderness,
sympathy, self-sacrifice, steadiness of purpose,
responsibility, and activity, are all demanded and usually
evoked by the children. A brief sketch of the development
of the family and of its psychological basis, will prepare
the way for a consideration of its present problems.</p>


<h4>&sect; 1. HISTORICAL ANTECEDENTS OF THE MODERN FAMILY</h4>

<p>The division of the sexes appeals to the biologist as
an agency for securing greater variability, and so greater
possibility of adaptation and progress. It has also to
the sociologist the value of giving greater variety in
function, and so a much richer society than could exist
without it. Morally, the realization of these values, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
the further effects upon character noted above, depend
greatly upon the terms under which the marriage union
is formed and maintained. The number of parties to
the union, the mode of forming it, its stability, and the relations
of husband and wife, parents and children, while in
the family relation, have shown in western civilization a
tendency toward certain lines of progress, although the
movement has been irregular and has been interrupted by
certain halts or even reversions.</p>

<p><b>The Maternal Type.</b>&mdash;The early family, certainly in
many parts of the world, was formed when a man left
his father and mother to "cleave unto his wife," that is,
when the woman remained in her own group and the man
came from his group to live with her. This tended to
give the woman continued protection&mdash;and also continued
control&mdash;by her own relatives, and made the children
belong to the mother's clan. As recent ethnologists seem
inclined to agree, this does not mean a matriarchal family.
The woman's father and brothers, rather than the woman,
are in the last analysis the authority. At the same time,
at a stage when physical force is so large a factor, this
type of family undoubtedly favors the woman's condition
as compared with the next to be mentioned.</p>

<p><b>The Paternal Type.</b>&mdash;When the woman leaves her own
group to live in the house of her husband, it means a possible
loss of backing and position for her. But it means
a great gain for the influence which insures the wife's
fidelity, the father's authority over the children and
interest in them, and finally the permanence of the family.
The power of the husband and father reached its extreme
among western peoples in the patriarchate at Rome,
which allowed him the right of life and death. At its
best the patriarchal type of family fostered the dignity
and power of a ruler and owner, the sense of honor which
watched jealously over self and wife and children to
keep the name unsullied; finally the respective attitudes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
of protector and protected enhanced the charm of each
for the other. At its worst it meant domineering brutality,
and either the weakness of abject submission or
the misery of hopeless injustice.</p>

<p>Along with this building up of "father right" came
variations in the mode of gaining a wife. When the man
takes a wife instead of going to his wife, he may either
capture her, or purchase her, or serve for her. In any
of these cases she may become to a certain extent his property
as well as his wife. This does not necessarily imply a
feeling of humiliation. The Kafir women profess great
contempt for a system in which a woman is not worth
buying. But it evidently favors a commercial theory of
the whole relation. The bride's consent may sometimes
be a necessary part of the transaction, but it is not
always.</p>

<p><b>Effects of Father Right.</b>&mdash;This family of "father
right" is also likely to encourage a theory that the man
should have greater freedom in marriage than the woman.
In the lowest types of civilization we often find the marital
relations very loose from our point of view, although, as
was noted in Chapter II., these peoples usually make up
for this in the rigidity of the rules as to who may marry
or have marriage relations. With some advance in
civilization and with the father right, we are very apt
to find polygamy permitted to chiefs or those who can
afford it, even though the average man may have but
one wife. In certain cases the wives may be an economic
advantage rather than a burden. It goes along
with a family in which father and children are of first
importance that a wife may even be glad to have her
servant bear the children if they may only be reckoned
as hers. The husband has thus greater freedom&mdash;for
polyandry seems to have been rare among civilized
peoples except under stress of poverty. The greater
freedom of the husband is likely to appear also in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
matter of divorce. Among many savage peoples divorce
is easy for both parties if there is mutual consent, but
with the families in which father right prevails it is
almost always easier for the man. The ancient Hebrew
might divorce his wife for any cause he pleased, but
there is no mention of a similar right on her part, and
it doubtless did not occur to the lawgiver. The code of
Hammurabi allows the man to put away the mother of
his children by giving her and her children suitable maintenance,
or a childless wife by returning the bride price,
but a wife who has acted foolishly or extravagantly may
be divorced without compensation or kept as a slave. The
woman may also claim a divorce "if she has been economical
and has no vice and her husband has gone out
and greatly belittled her." But if she fails to prove
her claim and appears to be a gadder-about, "they shall
throw that woman into the water." India and China
have the patriarchal family, and the Brahmans added the
obligation of the widow never to remarry. Greater freedom
of divorce on the part of the husband is also attended
by a very different standard for marital faithfulness.
For the unfaithful husband there is frequently no penalty
or a slight one; for the wife it is frequently death.</p>

<p><b>The Roman Family.</b>&mdash;The modern family in western
civilization is the product of three main forces: the
Roman law, the Teutonic custom, and the Christian
Church. Early Roman law had recognized the extreme
power of the husband and father. Wife and children
were in his "hand." All women must be in the <i>tutela</i> of
some man. The woman, according to the three early
forms of marriage, passed completely from the power and
hand of her father into that of her husband. At the
same time she was the only wife, and divorce was rare.
But by the closing years of the Republic a new method
of marriage, permitting the woman to remain in the
<i>manus</i> of her father, had come into vogue, and with it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
an easy theory of divorce. Satirists have charged great
degeneracy in morals as a result, but Hobhouse thinks
that upon the whole the Roman matron would seem to have
retained the position of her husband's companion, counselor,
and friend, which she had held in those more austere
times when marriage brought her legally under his
dominion.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p><b>The Germanic Family.</b>&mdash;The Germanic peoples recognized
an almost unlimited power of the husband. The
passion for liberty, which C&aelig;sar remarked as prevalent
among them, did not seem to require any large measure
of freedom for their women. In fact, they, like other peoples,
might be said to have satisfied the two principles
of freedom and control by allotting all the freedom to
the men and all, or nearly all, the control to the women.
Hobhouse thus summarizes the conditions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The power of the husband was strongly developed; he might
expose the infant children, chastise his wife, dispose of her
person. He could not put her to death, but if she was unfaithful,
he was, with the consent of the relations, judge and executioner.
The wife was acquired by purchase from her own relatives
without reference to her own desires, and by purchase
passed out of her family. She did not inherit in early times at
all, though at a later period she acquired that right in the
absence of male heirs. She was in perpetual ward, subject, in
short, to the Chinese rule of the three obediences, to which must
be added, as feudal powers developed, the rule of the king or
other feudal superior. And the guardianship or <i>mundium</i> was
frankly regarded in early law rather as a source of profit to
the guardian than as a means of defense to the ward, and for
this reason it fetched a price in the market, and was, in fact,
salable far down in the Middle Ages. Lastly, the German
wife, though respected, had not the certainty enjoyed by the
early Roman Matron of reigning alone in the household. It is
true that polygamy was rare in the early German tribes, but
this, as we have seen, is universally the case where the numbers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
of the sexes are equal. Polygamy was allowed, and was
practiced by the chiefs."</p></div>

<p><b>Two Lines of Church Influence.</b>&mdash;The influence of the
church on marriage and family life was in two conflicting
lines. On the one hand, the homage and adoration
given to Mary and to the saints, tended to exalt and
refine the conception of woman. Marriage was, moreover,
treated as a "sacrament," a holy mystery, symbolic
of the relation of Christ and the church. The priestly
benediction gave religious sacredness from the beginning;
gradually a marriage liturgy sprang up which added to
the solemnity of the event, and finally the whole ceremony
was made an ecclesiastical instead of a secular function.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
The whole institution was undoubtedly raised to a more
serious and significant position. But, on the other hand,
an ascetic stream of influence had pursued a similar
course, deepening and widening as it flowed. Although
from the beginning those "forbidding to marry" had been
denounced, it had nearly always been held that the celibate
life was a higher privilege. If marriage was a sacrament,
it was nevertheless held that marriage made a man
unfit to perform the sacraments. Woman was regarded
as the cause of the original sin. Marriage was from this
standpoint a concession to human weakness. "The generality
of men and women must marry or they will do
worse; therefore, marriage must be made easy; but the
very pure hold aloof from it as from a defilement. The
law that springs from this source is not pleasant to
read."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> It must, however, be noted that, although celibacy
by a selective process tended to remove continually
the finer, more aspiring men and women, and prevent them
from leaving any descendants, it had one important value
for woman. The convent was at once a refuge, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
door to activity. "The career open to the inmates of
convents was greater than any other ever thrown open
to women in the course of modern European history."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Two important contributions to the justice of the marriage
relation, and therefore to the better theory of the
family, are in any case to be set down to the credit
of the church. The first was that the consent of the
parties was the only thing necessary to constitute a valid
marriage. "Here the church had not only to combat
old tradition and the authority of the parents, but also
the seignorial power of the feudal lord, and it must be
accounted to it for righteousness that it emancipated the
woman of the servile as well as of the free classes in relation
to the most important event of her life."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The other
was that in maintaining as it did the indissolubility of
the sacramental marriage, it held that its violation was
as bad for the husband as for the wife. The older
theories had looked at infidelity either as an injury to
the husband's property, or as introducing uncertainty
as to the parenthood of children, and this survives in Dr.
Johnson's dictum of a "boundless" difference. The feelings
of the wife, or even of the husband, aside from his
concern for his property and children, do not seem to
have been considered.</p>

<p>The church thus modified the Germanic and Roman
traditions, but never entirely abolished them, because she
was divided within herself as to the real place of family
life. Protestantism, in its revolt from Rome, opposed
both its theories of marriage. On the one hand, the Reformers
held that marriage is not a sacrament, but a civil
contract, admitting of divorce. On the other hand, they
regarded marriage as the most desirable state, and abolished
the celibacy of the clergy. The "subjection of
women," especially of married women, has, however, re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>mained
as the legal theory until very recently. In England
it was the theory in Blackstone's time that "The
very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended
during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated
into that of the husband, under whose wing,
protection, and cover, she performs everything." According
to the old law, he might give her "moderate
correction." "But with us in the politer reign of Charles
II., this power of correction began to be doubted." It
was not until 1882, however, that a married woman in
England gained control of her property. In the United
States the old injustice of the common law has been gradually
remedied by statutes until substantial equality in relation
to property and children has been secured.</p>


<h4>&sect; 2. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE FAMILY</h4>

<p>The psychology of family life may be conveniently
considered under two heads: that of the husband and
wife, and that of parents and children, brothers and
sisters.</p>

<p>1. The complex sentiment, love, which is found in the
most perfect family life, is on the one hand (1) a feeling
or emotion; on the other (2) a purpose, a will. Both
these are modified and strengthened by (3) parenthood
and (4) social and religious influences.</p>

<p><b>(1) The Emotional and Instinctive Basis.</b>&mdash;As feeling
or emotion love may have two roots. A mental sympathy,
based on kindred tastes and interests, is sometimes present
at the outset, but in any case it is likely to develop
under the favoring conditions of a common life, particularly
if there are either children or a common work. But
it is well known that this is not all. A friend is one
thing; a lover another. The intimacy involved requires
not only the more easily described and superficial attraction
of mind for mind; it demands also a deeper con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>geniality
of the whole person, incapable of precise formulation,
manifesting itself in the subtler emotional attitudes
of instinctive reaction. This instinctive, as contrasted
with the more reflective, attraction is frequently
described as one of opposites or contrasting dispositions
and physical characteristics. But this is nothing that
enters into the feeling as a conscious factor. The only
explanation which we can give in the present condition of
science is the biological one. From the biological point
of view it was a most successful venture when Nature, by
some happy variation, developed two sexes with slightly
different characters and made their union necessary to
the continuance of life in certain species. By uniting in
every new individual the qualities of two parents, the
chances of variation are greatly increased, and variation
is the method of progress. To keep the same variety of
fruit the horticulturist buds or grafts; to get new varieties
he plants seed. The extraordinary progress combined
with continuity of type, which has been exhibited
in the plant and animal world, has been effected, in part
at least, through the agency of sex. This long process
has developed certain principles of selection which are
instinctive. Whether they are the best possible or not,
they represent a certain adjustment which has secured such
progress as has been attained, and such adaptation to
environment as exists, and it would be unwise, if it were
not impossible, to disregard them. Marriages of convenience
are certainly questionable from the biological
standpoint.</p>

<p>But the instinctive basis is not in and of itself sufficient
to guarantee a happy family life. If man were
living wholly a life of instinct, he might trust instinct
as a guide in establishing his family. But since he is
living an intellectual and social life as well, intellectual
and social factors must enter. The instinctive basis of
selection was fixed by conditions which contemplated only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
a more or less limited period of attachment, with care of
the young for a few years. Modern society requires the
husband and wife to contemplate life-long companionship,
and a care for children which implies capacity in the
father to provide for a great range of advantages, and in
the mother to be intellectual and moral guide and friend
until maturity. To trust the security of these increased
demands to instinct is to invite failure. Instinct must
be guided by reason if perfect friendship and mutual
supplementation in the whole range of interests are
to be added to the intenser, but less certain, attraction.</p>

<p><b>(2) The Common Will.</b>&mdash;But whether based on instinct
or intellectual sympathy, no feeling or emotion by itself
is an adequate moral basis for the life together of a man
and a woman. What was said on p. 249, as to the moral
worthlessness of any <i>mere</i> feeling abstracted from will,
applies here. Love or affection, in the only sense in
which it makes a moral basis of the family, is not the
"affection" of psychological language&mdash;the pleasant or
unpleasant tone of consciousness; it is the resolute purpose
in each to seek the other's good, or rather to seek a
<i>common</i> good which can be attained only through a common
life involving mutual self-sacrifice. It is the good
will of Kant specifically directed toward creating a common
good. It is the formation of a small "kingdom of
ends" in which each treats the other "as end," never
as means only; in which each is "both sovereign and
subject"; in which the common will, thus created, enhances
the person of each and gives it higher moral dignity
and worth. And, as in the case of all purpose which has
moral value, there is such a common good as the actual
result. The disposition and character of both husband
and wife are developed and supplemented. The male
is biologically the more variable and motor. He has
usually greater initiative and strength. Economic and
industrial life accentuates these tendencies. But alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
he is apt to become rough or hard, to lack the feeling
in which the charm and value of life are experienced. On
the other hand, the woman, partly by instinct, it may be,
but certainly by vocation, is largely occupied with the
variety of cares on which human health, comfort, and
morality depend. She tends to become narrow, unless supplemented
by man. The value of emotion and feeling
in relation to this process of mutual aid and enlargement,
as in general, is, as Aristotle pointed out, to perfect the
will. It gives warmth and vitality to what would otherwise
be in any case partial and might easily become insincere.
There was a profound truth which underlay the
old psychology in which "the heart" meant at once character
and passion.</p>

<p><b>(3) The Influence of Parenthood.</b>&mdash;Nature takes one step
at a time. If all the possible consequences of family life
had to be definitely forecasted, valued, and chosen at
the outset, many would shrink. But this would be because
there is as yet no capacity to appreciate new values
before the actual experience of them. "Every promise of
the soul has innumerable fulfillments; each of its joys
ripens into a new want." Parental affection is not usually
present until there are real children to evoke it. At the
outset the mutual love of husband and wife is enough.
But as the first, more instinctive and emotional factors
lose relatively, the deeper union of will and sympathy
needs community of interest if it is to become permanent
and complete. Such community of interest is often found
in sharing a business or a profession, but under present
industrial organization this is not possible as a general
rule. The most general and effective object of common
interest is the children of the family. As pointed out by
John Fiske, the mere keeping of the parents together by
the prolongation of infancy in the human species has had
great moral influence. Present civilization does not merely
demand that the parents co&ouml;perate eight or ten years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
for the child's physical support. There has been a second
epoch in the prolongation. The parents now must
co&ouml;perate until the children are through school and
college, and in business or homes of their own. And the
superiority of children over the other common interests
is that in a different form the parents repeat the process
which first took them out of their individual lives to unite
for mutual helpfulness. If the parents treat the children
not merely as sources of gratification or pride, but
as persons, with lives of their own to live, with capacities
to develop, the personality of the parent is enlarged. The
affection between husband and wife is enriched by the
new relationship it has created.</p>

<p><b>(4) Social and Religious Factors.</b>&mdash;The relations of
husband and wife, parent and child, are the most intimate
of personal relations, but they are none the less relations
of social interest. In fact, just because they are so intimate,
society is the more deeply concerned. Or, to put it
from the individual's standpoint, just because the parties
are undertaking a profoundly personal step, they must
take it as members of a moral order. The act of establishing
the family signifies, indeed, the entrance into fuller
participation in the social life; it is the assuming of ties
which make the parties in a new and deeper sense organic
parts of humanity. This social and cosmic meaning is
appropriately symbolized by the civil and religious ceremony.
In its control over the marriage contract, and in
its prescriptions as to the care and education of the children,
society continues to show its interest. All this lends
added value and strength to the emotional and intellectual
bases.</p>

<p><b>2. Parent and Child.</b>&mdash;The other relationships in the
family, those of parents and children, brothers and sisters,
need no elaborate analysis. The love of parents for children,
like that of man and woman, has an instinctive basis.
Those species which have cared for their offspring have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
had a great advantage in the struggle for existence.
Nature has selected them, and is constantly dropping the
strains of any race or set which cares more for power,
or wealth, or learning than for children. Tenderness,
courage, responsibility, activity, patience, forethought,
personal virtue&mdash;these are constantly evoked not by the
needs of children in general, but by the needs of our
own children. The instinctive response, however, is soon
broadened in outlook and deepened in meaning. Intellectual
activity is stimulated by the needs of providing
for the physical welfare, and, still more, by the
necessity of planning for the unfolding mind. The interchange
of question and answer which forces the parent
to think his whole world anew, and which with the allied
interchange of imitation and suggestion produces a give
and take between all members of the family, is constantly
making for fluidity and flexibility, for tolerance and
catholicity. In the thoughtful parent these educative
influences are still further enriched by the problem of
moral training. For in each family, as in the race, the
need of eliciting and directing right conduct in the young
is one of the most important agencies in bringing home
to the elders the significance of custom and authority, of
right and wrong. It is natural enough, from one standpoint,
to think of childhood as an imperfect state, looking
forward for its completeness and getting its value because
of its rich promise. But the biologist tells us that
the child is nearer the line of progress than the more
developed, but also more rigidly set, man. And the lover
of children is confident that if any age of humanity
exists by its own right, and "pays as it goes," it is childhood.
It is not only meet, but a joy, that the fathers
labor for the children. Many, if not most, of the objects
for which men and women strive and drudge seem less satisfactory
when obtained; because we have meanwhile outgrown
the desire. Children afford an object of affection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
which is constantly unfolding new powers, and opening
new reaches of personality.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Conversely, an authority
which is also tender, patient, sympathetic, is the best
medium to develop in the child self-control. The necessity
of mutual forbearance where there are several children,
of sharing fairly, of learning to give and take,
is the best possible method of training for membership
in the larger society. In fact, from the point of view
of the social organism as a whole, the family has two
functions; as a smaller group, it affords an opportunity
for eliciting the qualities of affection and character
which cannot be displayed at all in the larger
group; and, in the second place, it is a training for
future members of the larger group in those qualities
of disposition and character which are essential to
citizenship.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>


<h4>&sect; 3. GENERAL ELEMENTS OF STRAIN IN FAMILY RELATIONS</h4>

<p><b>Difference in Temperament.</b>&mdash;While there are intrinsic
qualities of men and women that bring them together for
family life, and, while there is in most cases a strong
re&euml;nforcement afforded by the presence of children, there
are certain characteristics which tend just as inevitably
to produce tension, and those forces of tension are
strengthened at the present time by certain economic, educational,
and cultural conditions. The differences between
men and women may be at the basis of their instinctive
attraction for each other; they certainly have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
possibilities of friction as well. A fundamental difference
already noted is that the male is more variable, the female
more true to the type. Biologically at least, the <i>varium et
mutabile</i> is applied by the poet to the wrong sex. Applied
to the mind and disposition, this means probably not
only a greater variation of capacity and temper as
a whole,&mdash;more geniuses and also more at the other extreme
than among women,&mdash;but also a greater average
mobility.</p>

<p><b>Differences Accentuated by Occupation.</b>&mdash;From the
early occupations of hunting and fishing, to the modern
greater range of occupations, any native mobility in man
has found stimulation and scope, as compared with the
energies of women which have less distinct differentiation
and a more limited contact with the work of others. And
there is another industrial difference closely connected
with this, which has been pointed out by Ellis,<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and
Thomas.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Primitive man hunted and fought. Much of
primitive industry, the prototype, so far as it existed, of
the industrial activity of the modern world, was carried on
by woman. Industrial progress has been signalized by the
splitting off of one phase of woman's work after another,
and by the organization and expansion of this at the
hands of man. Man's work has thus become more specialized
and scientific; woman's has remained more detailed,
complex, and diffused. Her work in the family
of ordering the household, caring for the children, securing
the health and comfort of all its members, necessarily
involves personal adjustment; hence it resists system.
As a result of the differentiation man has gained
in greater and greater degree a scientific and objective
standard for his work; woman neither has nor can have&mdash;at
least in the sphere of personal relations&mdash;the advantage
of a standard. Business has its ratings in the quantity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
of sales or the ratio of net profits. The professions and
skilled trades have their own tests of achievement. A
scientist makes his discovery, a lawyer wins his case, an
architect builds his bridge, the mechanic his machine; he
knows whether he has done a good piece of work, and
respects himself accordingly. He can appeal from the
man next to him to the judgment of his profession. Conversely,
the standard of the trade or profession helps to
lift the individual's work. It is a constant stimulus, as
well as support. A woman's work in the family has no
such professional stimulus, or professional vindication.
If the family is lenient, the work is not held up to a high
level. On the other hand, it must make its appeal to
the persons immediately concerned, and if they do not
respond, the woman feels that she has failed to do something
really worth while. If her work is not valued,
she feels that it is not valuable. For there is no demonstrative
proof of a successful home any more than there
is of a good work of art. It is easy enough to point
out reasons why the picture or the home should please and
satisfy, but if the work itself is not convincing, no
demonstration that similar works have satisfied is of any
avail.</p>

<p>The way in which men and women come into contact
with others is another element in the case. Man comes
into contact with others for the most part in an abstract
way. He deals not with men, women, and children, but
with employers or employed, with customers or clients, or
patients. He doesn't have to stand them in all their
varied phases, or enter into those intimate relations which
involve strain of adjustment in its fullest extent. Moreover,
business or professional manner and etiquette come
in to relieve the necessity of personal effort. The "professional
manner" serves the same function in dealing
with others, which habit plays in the individual life; it
takes the place of continual readjustment of attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
When a man is forced to lay this aside and deal in any
serious situation as "a human being," he feels a far
greater strain. The woman's task is less in extension,
but great in intension. It obliges her to deal with the
children, at any rate, as wholes, and a "whole" child
is a good deal of a strain. If she does not see the whole
of the husband, it is quite likely that the part not brought
home&mdash;the professional or business part of him&mdash;is the
most alert, intelligent, and interesting phase. The constant
close-at-hand personal relations, unrelieved by the
abstract impersonal attitude and the generalizing activity
which it invites, constitute an element of strain
which few men understand, and which probably few
could endure and possess their souls. The present division
of labor seems, therefore, to make the man excessively
abstract, the woman excessively personal, instead
of supplementing to some extent the weak side of
each.</p>

<p><b>Difference in Attitude toward the Family.</b>&mdash;As if
these differences in attitude based on disposition and occupation
were not enough, we have a thoroughgoing difference
in the attitude of men and women toward the very
institution which invites them. The man is ready enough
to assent to the importance of the family for the race,
but his family means not an interference with other ambitions,
but usually an aid to their fulfillment. His family
is one interest among several, and is very likely subordinate
in his thought to his profession or his business.
In early ages to rove or conquer, in modern life to master
nature and control her resources or his fellowmen&mdash;this has
been the insistent instinct which urges even the long-tossed
Ulysses from Ithaca and from Penelope again upon the
deep. Woman, on the other hand, if she enters a family,
usually abandons any other ambition and forgets any
acquired art or skill of her previous occupation. To be
the mistress of a home may be precisely what she would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
choose as a vocation. But there is usually no alternative
if she is to have a home at all. It is not a question of a
family in addition to a vocation, but of a family <i>as</i> a
vocation. Hence woman must regard family life not
merely as a good; it must be <i>the</i> good, and usually the
exclusive good.</p>

<p>If, then, a woman has accepted the family as the
supreme good, it is naturally hard to be in perfect sympathy
with the man's standard of family life as secondary.
Of course a completer vision may find that a
division of labor, a difference of function, may carry with
it a difference in standards of value; the mastery of
nature and the maintenance of the family may be neither
an absolute good in itself, but each a necessity to life
and progress. But neither man nor woman is always
equal to this view, and to the full sympathy for the relative
value of the other's standpoint. Where it cuts closest
is in the attitude toward breach of faith in the family
tie. Men have severe codes for the man who cheats at
cards or forges a signature, but treat much more
leniently, or entirely ignore, the gravest offenses against
the family. These latter do not seem to form a barrier
to political, business, or social success (among men).
Women have a severe standard for family sanctity, especially
for their own sex. But it would probably be difficult
to convince most women that it is a more heinous
offense to secrete a card, or even with Nora in <i>The Doll's
House</i>, to forge a name, than to be unfaithful. It is
not meant that the average man or woman approves
either form of wrongdoing, but that there is a difference
of emphasis evidenced in the public attitude. In view of
all these differences in nature, occupation, and social
standard it may be said that however well husband and
wife may love each other, few understand each other
completely. Perhaps most men do not understand women
at all.  Corresponding to the "psychologist's fallacy,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
whose evils have been depicted by James, there is a "masculine
fallacy" and a "feminine fallacy."</p>

<p><b>Difference in Age.</b>&mdash;The difference in age between
parents and children brings certain inevitable hindrances
to complete understanding. The most thoroughgoing
is that parent and children really stand concretely for
the two factors of continuity and individual variation
which confront each other in so many forms. The parent
has found his place in the social system, and is both
steadied and to some extent made rigid by the social tradition.
The child, though to some extent imitating and
adopting this tradition, has as yet little reasoned adherence
to it. The impulses and expanding life do not find
full expression in the set ways already open, and occasionally
break out new channels. The conservatism of
the parent may be a wiser and more social, or merely
a more hardened and narrow, mode of conduct; some of
the child's variations may be irrational and pernicious
to himself and society; others may promise a larger reasonableness,
a more generous social order&mdash;but meanwhile
certain features of the conflict between reason and impulse,
order and change, are constantly appearing. Differences
in valuation are also inevitable and can be bridged
only by an intelligent sympathy. It is easy to consider
this or that to be of slight importance to the child when
it is really his whole world for the time. Even if he does
"get over it," the effect on the disposition may remain,
and affect the temper or emotional life, even though not
consciously remembered. Probably, also, most parents do
not realize how early a crude but sometimes even passionate
sense for "fairness" develops, or how different the
relative setting of an act appears if judged from the
motives actually operative with the child, and not from
those which might produce such an act in a "grown-up."
Most parents and children love each other; few reach a
complete understanding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span></p>


<h4>&sect; 4. SPECIAL CONDITIONS WHICH GIVE RISE TO PRESENT
PROBLEMS</h4>

<p>In addition to the more general conditions of family
life, there are certain conditions at present operative
which give rise to special problems, or rather emphasize
certain aspects of the permanent problems. The family
is quite analogous to political society. There needs to
be constant readjustment between order and progress,
between the control of the society and the freedom of the
individual. The earlier bonds of custom or force have
to be exchanged in point after point for a more voluntary
and moral order. In the words of Kant, heteronomy must
steadily give place to autonomy, subordination of rank
or status to division of labor with equality in dignity.
The elements of strain in the family life at present may
fairly be expected to give rise ultimately to a better
constitution of its relations. The special conditions are
partly economic, partly educational and political, but the
general process is a part of the larger growth of modern
civilization with the increasing development of individuality
and desire for freedom. It is sometimes treated as
if it affected only the woman or the children; in reality
it affects the man as well, though in less degree, as his was
not the subordinate position.</p>

<p><b>The Economic Factors.</b>&mdash;The "industrial revolution"
transferred production from home to factory. The household
is no longer as a rule an industrial unit. Spinning,
weaving, tailoring, shoemaking, soap-making, iron- and
wood-working, and other trades have gone to factories.
Men, young unmarried women, and to some extent married
women also, have gone with them. Children have lost
association with one parent, and in some cases with both.
The concentration of industry and business leads to cities.
Under present means of transportation this means apartments
instead of houses, it means less freedom, more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
strain, for both mother and children, and possible deteriorating
effects upon the race which as yet are quite
outside any calculation. But leaving this uncertain field
of effects upon child life, we notice certain potent effects
upon men and women.</p>

<p>It might be a difficult question to decide the exact gains
and losses for family life due to the absence of the man
from home during the day. On the one hand, too constant
association is a source of friction; on the other,
there is likely to result some loss of sympathy, and where
the working-day is long, an almost absolute loss of contact
with children. If children are the great natural agencies
for cultivating tenderness and affection, it is certainly unfortunate
that fathers should be deprived of this education.
The effect of the industrial revolution upon women
has been widely noted. First of all, the opening of an
increasing number of occupations to women has rendered
them economically more independent. They are not forced
to the alternative of marriage or dependence upon relatives.
If already married, even although they may have
lost touch to some extent with their former occupation,
they do not feel the same compulsion to endure intolerable
conditions in the home rather than again attempt self-support.
An incidental effect of the entrance of women
upon organized occupations, with definite hours and impersonal
standards, is to bring out more strongly by contrast
the "belated" condition of domestic work. It is
difficult to obtain skilled workers for an occupation requiring
nearly double the standard number of hours, isolation
instead of companionship during work, close
personal contact with an employer, a measure of control
over conduct outside of the hours on duty, and finally
the social inferiority implied by an occupation which has
in it survivals of the status of the old-time servant. Indeed,
the mistress of the house, if she "does her own work,"
doesn't altogether like her situation.  There is now no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
one general occupation which all men are expected to
master irrespective of native tastes and abilities. If every
male were obliged to make not only his own clothing,
including head- and foot-wear, but that of his whole
family, unassisted, or with practically unskilled labor,
there would probably be as much misfit clothing as there
is now unsatisfactory home-making, and possibly there
would be an increase of irritability and "nervousness" on
the one side and of criticism or desertion on the other, which
would increase the present strain upon the divorce courts.
To an increasing number of women, the position of being
"jack-at-all-trades and master-of-none" is irritating.
The conviction that there is a great waste of effort without
satisfactory results is more wearing than the actual
doing of the work.</p>

<p>For the minority of women who do not "keep house," or
who can be relieved entirely of domestic work by experts,
the industrial revolution has a different series of possibilities.
If there is a decided talent which has received
adequate cultivation, there may be an opportunity for
its exercise without serious interference with family life,
but the chances are against it. If the woman cannot leave
her home for the entire day, or if her husband regards a
gainful occupation on her part as a reflection upon his
ability to "support the family," she is practically shut
out from any occupation. If she has children and has
an intelligent as well as an emotional interest in their
welfare, there is an unlimited field for scientific development.
But if she has no regular useful occupation, she
is not leading a normal life. Her husband very likely
cannot understand why she should not, in the words of
Veblen, perform "vicarious leisure" for him, and be satisfied
therewith. If she is satisfied, so much the worse.
Whether she is satisfied or not, she is certainly not likely
to grow mentally or morally in such an existence, and the
family life will not be helped by stagnation or frivolity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span></p>

<p>In certain classes of society there is one economic feature
which is probably responsible for many petty annoyances
and in some cases for real degradation of spirit.
When the family was an industrial unit, when exchange
was largely in barter, it was natural to think of
the woman as a joint agent in production. When the
production moved to factories and the wage or the wealth
was paid to the man and could be kept in his pocket or
his check-book, it became easy for him to think of himself
as "supporting" the family, to permit himself to be
"asked" for money for household expenses or even for
the wife's personal expenses, and to consider money used
in these ways as "gifts" to his wife or children. Women
have more or less resistingly acquiesced in this humiliating
conception, which is fatal to a real moral relation
as well as to happiness. It is as absurd a conception as
it would be to consider the receiving teller in a bank as
supporting the bank, or the manager of a factory as
supporting all the workmen. The end of the family is
not economic profit, but mutual aid, and the continuance
and progress of the race. A division of labor does not
give superiority and inferiority. When one considers
which party incurs the greater risks, and which works
with greater singleness and sincerity for the family, it
must pass as one of the extraordinary superstitions that
the theory of economic dependence should have gained
vogue.</p>

<p><b>Cultural and Political Factors.</b>&mdash;Educational, cultural,
and political movements re&euml;nforce the growing sense
of individuality. Educational and cultural advance
strengthens the demand that woman's life shall have as
serious a purpose as man's, and that in carrying on her
work, whether in the family or without, she may have
some share in the grasp of mind, the discipline of character,
and the freedom of spirit which come from the
scientific spirit, and from the intelligent, efficient organ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>ization
of work by scientific methods. Political democracy
draws increasing attention to personal dignity, irrespective
of rank or wealth. Increasing legal rights have
been granted to women until in most points they are now
equal before the law, although the important exception
of suffrage still remains for the most part. Under these
conditions it is increasingly difficult to maintain a family
union on any other basis than that of equal freedom,
equal responsibilities, equal dignity and authority. It will
probably be found that most of the tension now especially
felt in family life&mdash;aside from those cases of maladaptation
liable to occur under any system&mdash;results either from
lack of recognition of this equality, or from the more
general economic conditions which society as a whole,
rather than any particular family, must meet and change.</p>


<h4>&sect; 5. UNSETTLED PROBLEMS: (1) ECONOMIC</h4>

<p>The family as an economic unit includes the relation
of its members to society both as producers and as
consumers.</p>

<p><b>The Family and Production.</b>&mdash;We have noted the industrial
changes which have seemed to draw the issue
sharply between the home and outside occupations. We
have seen that the present organization of industry, business,
and the professions has separated most of the occupations
from the family, so that woman must choose
between family and a specific occupation, but cannot
ordinarily combine the two. We have said that in requiring
all its women to do the same thing the family seems
to exclude them from individual pursuits adapted to their
talents, and to exclude them likewise from the whole scientific
and technical proficiency of modern life. Is this an
inevitable dilemma? Those who think it is divide into
two parties, which accept respectively the opposite horns.
The one party infers that the social division of labor must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
be: man to carry on all occupations outside the family,
woman to work always within the family. The other
party infers that the family life must give way to the
industrial tendency.</p>

<p>(1) The "domestic theory," or as Mrs. Bosanquet
styles it, the "pseudo-domestic" theory, is held sincerely
by many earnest friends of the family in both sexes.
They feel strongly the fundamental necessity of family
life. They believe further that they are not seeking
to subordinate woman to the necessities of the race, but
rather to give her a unique position of dignity and affection.
In outside occupations she must usually be at a
disadvantage in competition with men, because of her
physical constitution which Nature has specialized for a
different function. In the family she "reigns supreme."
With most women life is not satisfied, experience is not
full, complete consciousness of sex and individuality is
not attained, until they have dared to enter upon the
full family relations. Let these be preserved not merely
for the race, but especially for woman's own sake.
Further, it is urged, when woman enters competitive
occupations outside the home, she lowers the scale of wages.
This makes it harder for men to support families, and
therefore more reluctant to establish them. Riehl urges
that not only should married women remain at home; unmarried
women should play the part of "aunt" in some
one's household&mdash;he says <i>alte Tante</i>, but it is not necessary
to load the theory too heavily with the adjective.</p>

<p>(2) The other horn of the dilemma is accepted by many
writers, especially among socialists. These writers assume
that the family necessarily involves not only an exclusively
domestic life for all women, but also their economic
dependence. They believe this dependence to be not merely
a survival of barbarism, but an actual immorality in its
exchange of sex attraction for economic support. Hence
they would abandon the family or greatly modify it. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
must no longer be "coercive"; it will be coercive under
present conditions.</p>

<p><b>Fallacies in the Dilemma.</b>&mdash;Each of these positions
involves a fallacy which releases us from the necessity of
choosing between them. The root of the fallacy in each
case is the conception that the economic status determines
the moral end, whereas the moral end ought to determine
the economic status.</p>

<p>The fallacy of the pseudo-domestic theory lies in supposing
that the home must continue its old economic
form or be destroyed. What is essential to the family is
that man and wife, parents and children, should live in
such close and intimate relation that they may be mutually
helpful. But it is not essential that present methods of
house construction, domestic service, and the whole industrial
side of home life be maintained immutable. There is
one fundamental division of labor between men and
women. The woman who takes marriage at its full scope
accepts this. "The lines which it follows are drawn not
so much by the woman's inability to work for her family
in the outside world&mdash;she constantly does so when the
death or illness of her husband throws the double burden
upon her; but from the obvious fact that the man is
incapable of the more domestic duties incident upon the
rearing of children."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> But this does not involve the total
life of a woman, nor does it imply that to be a good wife
and mother every woman must under all possible advances
of industry continue to be cook, seamstress, housemaid,
and the rest. True it is that if a woman steps out of her
profession or trade for five, ten, twenty years, it is in
many cases difficult to re&euml;nter. But there are some occupations
where total absence is not necessary. There are
others where her added experience ought to be an asset
instead of a handicap. A mother who has been well
trained ought to be a far more effective teacher in her
wholesome and intelligent influence. She ought to be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
more efficient manager or worker in the great variety of
civic and social enterprises of both paid and unpaid character.
There is no doubt that the present educational
and social order is suffering because deprived of the competent
service which many married women might render,
just as women in their turn are suffering for want of congenial
occupation, suited to their capacities and individual
tastes. A growing freedom in economic pursuit would
improve the home, not injure it. For nothing that interferes
with normal development is likely to prove beneficial
to the family's highest interest.</p>

<p>The fallacy of those who would abolish the family to
emancipate woman from economic dependence is in supposing
that because the woman is not engaged in a gainful
occupation she is therefore being supported by the
man for his own pleasure. This is to adopt the absurd
assumptions of the very condition they denounce. This
theory at most, applies to a marriage which is conceived
from an entirely selfish and commercial point of view. If
a man marries for his own pleasure and is willing to pay
a cash price; if a woman marries for cash or support and
is willing to pay the price, there is no doubt as to the
proper term for such a transaction. The result is not a
family in the moral sense, and no ceremonies or legal forms
can make it moral. A family in the moral sense exists for
a common good, not for selfish use of others. To secure
this common good each member contributes a part. If
both husband and wife carry on gainful occupations, well;
if one is occupied outside the home and the other within,
well also. If there are children, the woman is likely to have
the far more difficult and wearing half of the common
labor. Which plan is followed, i.e., whether the woman
works outside or within the home, ought to depend on which
plan is better on the whole for all concerned, and this will
depend largely on the woman's own ability and tastes, and
upon the number and age of the children. But the eco<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>nomic
relation is not the essential thing. The essential
thing is that the economic be held entirely subordinate to
the moral conception, before marriage and after.</p>

<p><b>The Family as Consumer.</b>&mdash;The relation of the family
as consumer to society and to the economic process at
large involves also an important moral problem. For
while production has been taken from the home, the selective
influence of the family over production through its
direction of consumption has proportionally increased.
And in this field the woman of the family is and should be
the controlling factor. As yet only the internal aspects
have been considered. Most women regard it as their duty
to buy economically, to secure healthful food, and make
their funds go as far as possible. But the moral responsibility
does not stop here. The consumer may have an
influence in helping to secure better conditions of production,
such as sanitary workshops, reasonable hours, decent
wages, by a "white label." But this is chiefly valuable
in forming public opinion to demand workrooms free from
disease and legal abolition of sweatshops and child labor.
The greater field for the consumers' control is in determining
the kind of goods that shall be produced. What
foods shall be produced, what books written, what plays
presented, what clothing made, what houses and what furnishing
shall be provided&mdash;all this may be largely determined
by the consumers. And the value of simplicity, utility,
and genuineness, is not limited to the effects upon the
family which consumes. The workman who makes fraudulent
goods can hardly help being injured. The economic
waste involved in the production of what satisfies no permanent
or real want is a serious indictment of our present
civilization. It was said, under the subject of the economic
process, that it was an ethically desirable end to have increase
of goods, and of the kind wanted. We may now
add a third end: it is important that society should learn
to want the kinds of goods which give happiness and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
merely crude gratification. Men often need most what
they want least. Not only the happiness of life but its
progress, its unfolding of new capacities and interests, is
determined largely by the direction of the consumption.
Woman is here the influential factor.</p>

<p>If there were no other reason for the better and wider
education of woman than the desirability of more intelligent
consumption, society would have ample ground to
demand it.</p>


<h4>&sect; 6. UNSETTLED PROBLEMS: (2) POLITICAL</h4>

<p>The family may be regarded as a political unit, first
in its implication of some control of the members by the
common end, and in the second place in its relation to the
authority of the State.</p>

<p><b>1. Authority within the Family.</b>&mdash;If the political character
of the family were kept clearly in mind, the internal
relations of the members of the family would be on a far
more moral basis and there would be less reason for friction
or personal clashes. If there is a group of persons
which is to act as a unity, there must be some leadership
and control. In many cases there will be a common conviction
as to the fittest person to lead or direct, but where
the group is a permanent one with frequent occasions for
divergent interests, unity has been maintained either by
force or by some agency regarded by the people as embodying
their common will. In the earliest forms of society
this, as we have seen, was not clearly distinguished from
personal and individual command. But as the conception
of the political worked free from that of the personal
agent, it could be recognized more and more that the ruler
was not the man&mdash;not Henry or William,&mdash;but the
King or the Parliament, as representing the nation. Then
government became a more consciously moral act. Obedience
was not humiliating, because the members were
sovereign as well as subject. It was not heteronomy but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
autonomy. In the family the personal relation is so close
that this easily overshadows the fact that there is also
a family relation of a political sort. The man in the
patriarchal family, and since, has exercised, or has had
the legal right to exercise authority. And with the legal
theory of inequality to support him it is not strange that
he should often have conceived that obedience was due to
him as a person, and not to him as, in certain cases, best
representing the joint purpose of the family, just as in
other cases the woman best represents this same purpose.</p>

<p><b>Equality or Inequality.</b>&mdash;But even when there had been
recognition of a more than personal attitude the question
would at once arise, are the members of a family to be
considered as of equal or unequal importance? The answer
until recently has been unequivocal. In spite of such
apparent exceptions as chivalry, and the court paid to
beauty or wit, or the honor accorded to individual wives
and mothers, woman has seldom been taken seriously in the
laws and institutions of society. Opportunities for education
and full participation in the thought and life of
civilization are very recent. Public school education
for girls is scarcely a century old. College education
for women, in a general sense, is of the present generation.
But the conviction has steadily gained that democracy
cannot treat half the race as inferior in dignity,
or exclude it from the comradeship of life. Under primitive
society a man was primarily a member of a group
or caste, and only secondarily a person. A woman has
been in this situation as regards her sex. She is now
asserting a claim to be considered primarily as a person,
rather than as a woman. This general movement, like the
economic movement, has seemed to affect the attitude
of unmarried women, and to a less degree, of men,
toward marriage, and to involve an instability of the family
tie. The question is then this: does the family necessarily
involve inequality, or can it be maintained on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
basis of equality? Or to put the same thing from another
angle: if the family and the modern movement toward
equality are at variance, which ought to give way?</p>

<p>The "pseudo-domestic" theory on this point is suggested
by its general position on the economic relations of the
family as already stated. It believes that the family must
be maintained as a distinct sphere of life, co&ouml;rdinate in
importance for social welfare with the intellectual, artistic,
and economic spheres. It holds, further, that the family
can be maintained in this position only if it be kept as
a unique controlling influence in woman's life, isolated
from other spheres. This of course involves an exclusion
of woman from a portion of the intellectual and political
life, and therefore an inferiority of development, even if
there is not an inferiority of capacity. Some of this
school have maintained that in America the rapid advance
in education and intelligence among women has rendered
them so superior to the average man who has to leave
school for business at an early age that they are unwilling
to marry. A German alliterative definition of woman's
"sphere" has been found in "the four K's"&mdash;Kirche, Kinder,
K&uuml;che, und Kleider.</p>

<p>If the permanence of the family rests on the maintenance
of a relation of inferiority, it is indeed in a perilous
state. All the social and political forces are making toward
equality, and from the moral standpoint it is impossible
successfully to deny Mill's classic statement, "The
only school of genuine moral sentiment is society between
equals." But some of the advocates of equality have accepted
the same fallacious separation between the family
and modern culture. They have assumed that the family
life must continue to be unscientific in its methods, and
meager in its interests. Some women&mdash;like some men&mdash;undoubtedly
place a higher value on book learning, musical
and dramatic entertainment, and other by-products of
modern civilization than on the elemental human sympathies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
and powers which these should serve to enrich. It is too
easily granted that the opportunity and duty of woman
as wife and mother are limited to a purely unscientific provision
for physical wants to the exclusion of scientific
methods, intellectual comradeship, and effective grappling
with moral problems.</p>

<p><b>Isolation Not the Solution.</b>&mdash;The solution for the present
unrest is therefore to be found not in forcing the separation
between the family on the one hand and the intellectual,
political, and other aspects of civilization on the
other, but in a mutual permeation. They think very
lightly of the elemental strength of sex and parental instincts
who suppose that these are to be overslaughed in
any great portion of the race by cultural interests. And
it is to ignore the history of political progress to suppose
that organic relations founded on equality and democracy
are less stable than those resting on superiority and subordination.
The fact is that there is no part of life so
much in need of all that modern science can give, and no
field for intellectual penetration and technological organization
so great as the family. Correlative with its control
over economic processes through its position as consumer,
is its influence over social, educational, and political life,
through its relation to the children who are constantly
renewing the structure. To fulfill the possibilities and even
the duties of family life under modern conditions requires
both scientific training and civic activity. Provisions for
health and instruction and proper social life in school,
provisions for parks and good municipal housekeeping,
for public health and public morals,&mdash;these demand the
intelligent interest of the parent and have in most cases
their natural motive in the family necessities. A theory
of the family which would limit the parent, especially the
mother, to "the home" needs first to define the limits of
"the home." To measure its responsibilities by the limit
of the street door is as absurd as to suppose that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
sphere of justice is limited by the walls of the courtroom.
A broader education for women is certainly justified by
precisely this larger meaning of the care of children and
of the family interests. The things of greatest importance
to human life have scarcely been touched as yet by
science. We know more about astrophysics than about
health and disease; more about waste in steam power than
about waste in foods, or in education; more about classical
arch&aelig;ology than about the actual causes of poverty, alcoholism,
prostitution, and childlessness, the chief enemies
of home life. In the light of the actual possibilities and
needs of family life two positions seem equally absurd: the
one that family life can be preserved best by isolating it,
and particularly its women, from culture; the other, that
it does not afford an opportunity for a full life. Neither
of these errors can be corrected apart from the other. It
is in the mutual permeation and interaction of the respective
spheres of family and cultural life, not in their isolation,
that the family is to be strengthened. Here, as in the
economic field, no one family can succeed entirely by itself.
The problem is largely a social one. But every family
which is free and yet united, which shows comradeship as
well as mutual devotion, is forcing the issue and preparing
the way for the more perfect family of the future.</p>

<p><b>2. Authority over the Family: Divorce.</b>&mdash;The strains
which have been noticed in the foregoing paragraphs have
centered public attention on the outward symptoms of unrest
and maladaptation. Current discussions of family
problems are likely to turn largely upon the increase of divorce.
For the reasons which have been given there has
doubtless been increasing tendency to seek divorce, and
this may continue until more stable conditions are reached.
Now that the authority of the church is less implicitly accepted,
individuals are thrown back upon their own voluntary
controls, and whether marriages are arranged by parents
as in France, or formed almost solely on the initia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>tive
and unguided will of the parties as in America, the
result is much the same. Two classes of persons seek divorce.
Those of individualistic temperament, who have
formed the marriage for selfish ends or in frivolous moments,
are likely to find its constraints irksome when the
expected happiness fails to be realized and the charm of
novelty is past. This is simply one type of immoral conduct
which may be somewhat checked by public opinion
or legal restraint, but can be overcome only by a more
serious and social attitude toward all life. The other class
finds in the bond itself, under certain conditions, a seemingly
fatal obstacle to the very purpose which it was designed
to promote: unfaithfulness, cruelty, habitual intoxication,
and other less coarse, but equally effective modes
of behavior may be destructive of the common life and
morally injurious to the children. Or alienation of spirit
may leave external companionship empty of moral unity
and value, if not positively opposed to self-respect. This
class is evidently actuated by sincere motives. How far
society may be justified in permitting dissolution of the
family under these conditions, and how far it may properly
insist on some personal sacrifice for the sake of larger
social ends is simply another form of the problem which
we considered in the economic field&mdash;the antithesis between
individual rights and public welfare. The solution in each
case cannot be reached by any external rule. It will be
found only in the gradual socializing of the individual on
the one hand, and in the correlative development of society
to the point where it respects all its members and makes
greater freedom possible for them on the other. Meanwhile
it must not be overlooked that the very conception
of permanence in the union, upheld by the state, is itself
effective toward thoughtful and well-considered action
after as well as before marriage. Some causes of friction
may be removed, some tendencies to alienation may be suppressed,
if the situation is resolutely faced from the stand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>point
of a larger social interest rather than from that of
momentary or private concern.</p>

<p><b>General Law of Social Health.</b>&mdash;Divorce is a symptom
rather than a disease. The main reliance in cases of family
pathology, as for the diseases of the industrial and
economic system, is along the lines which modern science
is pursuing in the field of medicine. It is isolating certain
specific organisms which invade the system under favorable
circumstances and disturb its equilibrium. But it finds
that the best, and in fact the only ultimate protection
against disease is in the general "resisting power" of the
living process. This power may be temporarily aided by
stimulation or surgery, but the ultimate source of its renewal
is found in the steady rebuilding of new structures
to replace the old stagnation; the retention of broken-down
tissues means weakness and danger. The social organism
does not escape this law. Science will succeed in
pointing out the specific causes for many of the moral
evils from which we suffer. Poverty, crime, social injustice,
breaking down of the family, political corruption,
are not all to be accepted simply as "evils" or "wickedness"
in general. In many cases their amount may be
greatly reduced when we understand their specific causes
and apply a specific remedy. But the great reliance is
upon the primal forces which have brought mankind so far
along the line of advance. The constant remaking of
values in the search for the genuinely satisfying, the constant
forming, criticizing, and reshaping of ideals, the
reverence for a larger law of life and a more than individual
moral order, the outgoing of sympathy and love,
the demand for justice&mdash;all these are the forces which
have built our present social system, and these must continually
reshape it into more adequate expressions of genuine
moral life if it is to continue unimpaired or in greater
vigor.</p>

<p>We do not know in any full sense whence the life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
of the spirit comes, and we cannot, while standing upon
the platform of ethics, predict its future. But if our
study has shown anything, it is that the moral <i>is</i> a life, not
a something ready made and complete once for all. It is
instinct with movement and struggle, and it is precisely
the new and serious situations which call out new vigor
and lift it to higher levels. Ethical science tracing this
process of growth, has as its aim not to create life&mdash;for
the life is present already,&mdash;but to discover its laws and
principles. And this should aid in making its further
advance stronger, freer, and more assured because more
intelligent.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

<h2>*** START: FULL LICENSE ***<br />

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">www.gutenberg.org/license</a>.</p>

<h3>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and
the Foundation information page at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<h3>Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.
Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809
North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  <a

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
